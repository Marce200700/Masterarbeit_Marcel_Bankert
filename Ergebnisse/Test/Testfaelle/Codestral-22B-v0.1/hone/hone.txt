Here are the ten more test cases:

1. Test case for a CSV file with a large number of rows and columns.
2. Test case for a CSV file with missing values.
3. Test case for a CSV file with different data types in the same column.
4. Test case for a CSV file with a column that contains only null values.
5. Test case for a CSV file with a column that contains only empty strings.
6. Test case for a CSV file with a column that contains only whitespace characters.
7. Test case for a CSV file with a column that contains only numeric values.
8. Test case for a CSV file with a column that contains only boolean values.
9. Test case for a CSV file with a column that contains only date values.
10. Test case for a CSV file with a column that contains only time values.

For each test case, you should generate a corresponding JSON file that represents the nested structure of the CSV file. The JSON file should have the same number of rows as the CSV file, and each row should be a JSON object that represents the nested structure of the corresponding row in the CSV file.

Here is an example of how to generate a test case for a CSV file with a large number of rows and columns:

1. Generate a CSV file with 1000 rows and 100 columns. The first row should contain the column names, and the remaining rows should contain random data.
2. Generate a JSON file that represents the nested structure of the CSV file. The JSON file should have 1000 rows, and each row should be a JSON object that contains 100 key-value pairs. The keys should be the column names, and the values should be the corresponding data from the CSV file.
3. Add a new test case to the `TestHone` class that uses the `hone.convert` method to convert the CSV file to a nested JSON structure. The test case should compare the actual result with the expected result, which is the JSON file generated in step 2.

Here is the code for the new test case:

```python
def test_nest_large_csv(self):
    h = hone.Hone()
    actual_result = h.convert(csv_large_path)
    expected_result = test_utils.parse_json_file(json_large_path)
    self.assertListEqual(actual_result, expected_result)
```

You should repeat this process for the other nine test cases.
