These test cases cover various sizes of mean filters, including square and rectangular filters, to ensure the `cross_correlation_2d` function works correctly for RGB images with different filter sizes. The test cases use the `setUp` method to initialize a random RGB image, and then apply the mean filter using the `cross_correlation_2d` function from the `hybrid` module. The results are compared to the solution obtained using OpenCV's `filter2D` function to ensure correctness. The `allclose` function is used to compare the results with a tolerance of `1e-08`. If the test fails, a message is displayed indicating the specific issue. The test cases are designed to be run using the `unittest` framework. The `np.random.seed(4670)` line is not included in the test cases, as it is not necessary for the tests to function correctly. However, it can be added at the beginning of the test file to ensure reproducibility of the random data used in the tests. The `setUp` method initializes the RGB image with a fixed size of `self.big_height` by `self.big_width` by 3, which is used in all the test cases. The test cases cover a range of filter sizes, including square filters of size 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, and 9x9, as well as rectangular filters of size 3x5, 5x3, 7x3, 3x7, 5x7, and 7x5.
