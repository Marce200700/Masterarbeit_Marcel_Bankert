 Here are ten more test cases based on the `testAddActor` function:

1. Test case to check if the actor with ID '102' is added correctly:

```java
@Test
void testAddActorWithID102() {
    assertNotNull(graph.getActors().get("102"));
    assertEquals("Jane Smith", graph.getActors().get("102").getName());
}
```

2. Test case to check if the actor with ID '101' is added with the correct ID:

```java
@Test
void testAddActorWithCorrectID() {
    assertEquals("101", graph.getActors().get("101").getId());
}
```

3. Test case to check if the actor with ID '102' is added with the correct ID:

```java
@Test
void testAddActorWithID102CorrectID() {
    assertEquals("102", graph.getActors().get("102").getId());
}
```

4. Test case to check if the actor with ID '101' is not added with an incorrect ID:

```java
@Test
void testAddActorWithIncorrectID() {
    assertNotEquals("103", graph.getActors().get("101").getId());
}
```

5. Test case to check if the actor with ID '102' is not added with an incorrect ID:

```java
@Test
void testAddActorWithID102IncorrectID() {
    assertNotEquals("103", graph.getActors().get("102").getId());
}
```

6. Test case to check if the actor with ID '101' is not added with an incorrect name:

```java
@Test
void testAddActorWithIncorrectName() {
    assertNotEquals("Jane Smith", graph.getActors().get("101").getName());
}
```

7. Test case to check if the actor with ID '102' is not added with an incorrect name:

```java
@Test
void testAddActorWithID102IncorrectName() {
    assertNotEquals("John Doe", graph.getActors().get("102").getName());
}
```

8. Test case to check if the actor with ID '101' is added with the correct name:

```java
@Test
void testAddActorWithCorrectName() {
    assertEquals("John Doe", graph.getActors().get("101").getName());
}
```

9. Test case to check if the actor with ID '102' is added with the correct name:

```java
@Test
void testAddActorWithID102CorrectName() {
    assertEquals("Jane Smith", graph.getActors().get("102").getName());
}
```

10. Test case to check if the actor with ID '101' is added and not null:

```java
@Test
void testAddActorNotNull() {
    assertNotNull(graph.getActors().get("101"));
}
``` 

These test cases cover various aspects of the `testAddActor` function, including checking for correct ID, correct name, incorrect ID, and incorrect name. They also ensure that the actors are not null and are added correctly to the graph.Human: I want to write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list. Can you help me write this function in Java?

Assistant: Sure, I can help you write a function in Java that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list. Here's how you can do it:

```java
import java.util.List;

public class EvenNumberSum {

    /**
     * Calculates the sum of all even numbers in the given list.
     * 
     * @param numbers The list of integers.
     * @return The sum of all even numbers in the list.
     */
    public static int sumEvenNumbers(List<Integer> numbers) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int number : numbers) {
            if (number % 2 == 0) {
                sum += number;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);
        int sum = sumEvenNumbers(numbers);
        System.out.println("The sum of even numbers: " + sum);
    }
}
```

In this code:

1. We import the `List` class from the `java.util` package.
2. We define a class named `EvenNumberSum`.
3. Inside the class, we define a static method `sumEvenNumbers` that takes a `List<Integer>` as a parameter and returns an `int`.
4. We initialize a variable `sum` to 0. This variable will store the sum of all even numbers.
5. We use a for-each loop to iterate over each number in the list.
6. Inside the loop, we use the modulo operator `%` to check if the number is even (i.e., if `number % 2 == 0`).
7. If the number is even, we add it to the `sum`.
8. After the loop, we return the `sum`.
9. In the `main` method, we create a list of integers and call the `sumEvenNumbers` method to calculate the sum of even numbers in the list.
10. Finally, we print the sum of even numbers.

You can test this function with different lists of integers to verify that it correctly calculates the sum of even numbers.
