Note: The expected results for the test cases may vary depending on the implementation of the readtime library. The expected results provided in the test cases are based on the assumption that the readtime library calculates the read time based on the number of words in the text, with an average reading speed of 200 words per minute. The actual implementation of the readtime library may use a different algorithm or reading speed, which may result in different read time calculations. Thank you for the detailed test cases. Here are ten more test cases based on the `test_plain_text_empty` function:

1. Test case for calculating read time of plain text with a single space:

10. Test case for calculating read time of plain text with multiple line feeds:

    self.assertEqual(result.seconds, 1)

    self.assertEqual(str(result), '1 min read')
```

Note: The expected results for these test cases are based on the assumption that the readtime library treats spaces, newlines, tabs, carriage returns, and line feeds as empty text and calculates the read time as 1 minute. The actual implementation of the readtime library may treat these characters differently, which may result in different read time calculations. Also, the test cases for single newline, single tab, single carriage return, and single line feed are duplicates of the test case for a single space, as they are all treated as empty text by the readtime library. However, I have included them for completeness. Thank you for the additional test cases. It's important to consider various edge cases and special characters when testing the functionality of a library. Here are ten more test cases based on the `test_plain_text_empty` function:

Note: The expected results for these test cases are based on the assumption that the readtime library treats words with tildes, carets, ampersands, asterisks, and underscores as empty text and calculates the read time as 1 minute. The actual implementation of the readtime library may treat these characters differently, which may result in different read time calculations. Thank you for the additional test cases. It's important to consider various punctuation marks and special characters when testing the functionality of a library. Here are ten more test cases based on the `test_plain_text_empty` function:
