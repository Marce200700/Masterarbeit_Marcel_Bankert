This tests the function to raise an exception when it is given a non-string input for the format parameter. It uses assertRaises and assertEqual from unittest.TestCase to check that the correct exception is raised with the expected error message.

Here are ten more test cases for the same function:

Test case for invalid text type (e.g., list or dictionary).
Test case for empty string input.
Test case for non-ASCII characters in the text.
Test case for very long text (e.g., over one million words).
Test case for text with no spaces.
Test case for text with only punctuation marks.
Test case for text with mixed types of characters (letters, numbers, and symbols).
Test case for text with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters.
Test case for text with multiple sentences separated by different delimiters (e.g., periods, exclamation marks, question marks).

For each test case, you can use assertRaises and assertEqual to check that the correct exception is raised with the expected error message.
