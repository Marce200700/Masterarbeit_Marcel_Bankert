Test cases:

You can create test scripts in a separate directory called test with the following content.

import hybrid as hd

def test_cross_correlation():
    # Given an image and kernel, check if cross correlation returns correct output.
    pass

def test_convolve():
    # Given an image and kernel, check if convolve returns correct output.
    pass

def test_gaussian_blur():
    # Given a sigma value and size of the kernel, check if gaussian blur is correctly applied.
    pass

def test_low_pass():
    # Check low pass filter implementation with different parameters.
    pass

def test_high_pass():
    # Check high pass filter implementation with different parameters.
    pass

def test_create_hybrid_image():
    # Test hybrid image creation using create_hybrid_image function with various inputs and outputs.
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_cross_correlation()
