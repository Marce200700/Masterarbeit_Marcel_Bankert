I have generated the unit tests for the project based on the given software requirements specification, software design, and source code. The unit tests are divided into separate source code files, each focusing on testing a specific unit of the project.

Here are the unit test files that have been generated:

1. `test_api.py`: This file contains unit tests for the `api.py` module. It tests the `of_text`, `of_html`, and `of_markdown` functions to ensure they return the correct reading time for the given content.

2. `test_result.py`: This file contains unit tests for the `result.py` module. It tests the `Result` class to ensure it correctly calculates the reading time in minutes and seconds, and provides the text representation of the read time. It also tests the operator methods added dynamically to the class.

3. `test_utils.py`: This file contains unit tests for the `utils.py` module. It tests the `read_time`, `read_time_as_seconds`, and `parse_html` functions to ensure they handle different content formats correctly and return the expected results.

These unit test files can be executed using a test runner to verify the correctness of the project's implementation.
