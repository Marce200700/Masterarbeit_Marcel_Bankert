 

The log should be classified as 'Defective'. The reason for this classification is that the log contains an error message 'ERROR: Operation cancelled by user' at the end, indicating that the operation was interrupted or cancelled by the user, which is an error. Additionally, the log shows a lot of repeated lines with the same message, which may indicate a problem with the installation process.
