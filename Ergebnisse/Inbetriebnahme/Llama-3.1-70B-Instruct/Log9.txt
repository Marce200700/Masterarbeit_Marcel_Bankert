 

## Step 1: Read the log to identify any errors or issues.
The log provided is a simple output from a Python test run, indicating that 4 tests were executed in 0.001 seconds with no errors reported.

## Step 2: Determine the classification based on the presence or absence of errors.
Since the log does not contain any error messages or indications of test failures, it suggests that the test run was successful.

## Step 3: Choose the appropriate class based on the analysis.
Given that there are no errors or issues reported in the log, it should be classified as 'Ok'.

The final answer is: Ok
