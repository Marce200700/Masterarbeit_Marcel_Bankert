 I would classify this log as 'Ok'. The reason for this classification is that the log does not contain any error messages. The installation of sqlite3 and libsqlite3-dev seems to have completed successfully, as indicated by the lines "Setting up libsqlite3-0:amd64 (3.37.2-2ubuntu0.3) ...", "Setting up libsqlite3-dev:amd64 (3.37.2-2ubuntu0.3) ...", and "Setting up sqlite3 (3.37.2-2ubuntu0.3) ...". There are no error messages or indications of failed installations, which suggests that the installation was successful.
