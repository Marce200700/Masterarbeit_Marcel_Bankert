 I would classify the previous log in the class 'Defective'. The reason for this classification is that the log contains an error message indicating that the build failed with an exception. Specifically, the error message states that there is a "Problem configuring task :run from command line" and that the command-line option '-n' is unknown. This suggests that there was an issue with the configuration or execution of the build process, which is a defect. Additionally, the log contains the phrase "BUILD FAILED", which is a clear indication of an error.
