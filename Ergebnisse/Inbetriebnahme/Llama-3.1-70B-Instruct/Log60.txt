 

## Step 1: Read the log to identify any errors
The log provided is a command-line output indicating the execution of a Python script named "test_acceptance.py" in a specific directory. The output message is "All acceptance tests passed!"

## Step 2: Determine the presence of errors
Based on the message "All acceptance tests passed!", it is clear that there are no errors reported in the log. The successful execution of the tests without any failures or errors is explicitly stated.

## Step 3: Classify the log
Given that there are no errors in the log, it should be classified as 'Ok'. This classification is based on the instruction that logs without errors should be categorized as 'Ok'.

The final answer is: Ok.
