 

The chosen class is 'Defective'. The reason for this classification is that the log contains an error message. Specifically, it says "ERROR 404: Not Found" when trying to download a file from a URL, and later it says "ERROR: failed to solve: process ... did not complete successfully: exit code: 8". This indicates that the Docker build process encountered an error and was unable to complete successfully. Therefore, the log is classified as 'Defective'.
