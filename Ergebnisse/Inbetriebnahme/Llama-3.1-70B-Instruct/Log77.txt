 

## Step 1: Analyze the log for errors
The log provided contains several messages, including the initiation of server activation, launching of the Oracle Java SE Language Server, and an error message indicating that the server cannot run on older versions of Java than Java 17.

## Step 2: Identify the key error message
The key error message in the log is "Cannot run on older versions of Java than Java 17. Please install Java 17 or newer or use --jdkhome switch to point to its installation directory." This message clearly indicates that there is an issue with the Java version being used.

## Step 3: Determine the class based on the error
Given the presence of an error message that indicates a problem with the Java version, the log should be classified as 'Defective'. This is because the error message suggests that there is a problem that needs to be addressed in order for the Oracle Java SE Language Server to function properly.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Defective}$
