 

## Step 1: Analyze the log for any error messages
The log provided is a test result from running a Python script, and it does not contain any explicit error messages.

## Step 2: Check for any indicators of failure
The log indicates that 3 tests were run in 0.002 seconds and ends with "OK", which suggests that all tests passed successfully.

## Step 3: Determine the classification based on the analysis
Since there are no error messages or indicators of failure in the log, it should be classified as 'Ok'.

The final answer is: Ok
