 The final answer should be: Class: Defective The reason for this classification is that the log contains an error message. The error message is: "E: Unable to locate package sqlite" and "E: Unable to locate package libsqlite-dev". This indicates that the Docker build process encountered an error while trying to install the sqlite and libsqlite-dev packages. The error code "exit code: 100" also confirms that the process did not complete successfully. Therefore, the log is classified as 'Defective'.
