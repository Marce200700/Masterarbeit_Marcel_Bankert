 I would classify the previous log as 'Ok'. The reason for this classification is that the log does not contain any error messages. The commands executed in the log (rm, g++, etc.) seem to have completed successfully, and there are no indications of errors or warnings. The log appears to be a successful compilation and linking of a C++ program, with no issues reported.
