Class: Defective

Reason: The log contains several errors and warnings, such as "i ｢wdm｣: Compiled successfully." which contradicts the presence of errors. The log also mentions "404s will fallback to /index.html," indicating that there might be issues with asset loading, which is a common sign of a defective log. Additionally, the log does not provide specific error messages or details about what went wrong during the compilation process, which further supports the classification as 'Defective'.
