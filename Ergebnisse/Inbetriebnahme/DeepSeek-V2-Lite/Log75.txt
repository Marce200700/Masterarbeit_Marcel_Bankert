Classified as: Defective

Reason: The log contains multiple errors and failures in the test execution, which indicates a problem with the system or the tests themselves. The error message "redis-cli: command not found" suggests that the necessary Redis command-line tool is missing, which is likely causing the test failures. Additionally, the presence of "FAILED" in multiple test cases indicates that the tests are not passing as expected. This situation is not 'Ok' because it indicates a failure in the execution or setup of the tests, which is a defect in the system or the environment.
