Classify the log: Defective

Reason: The log contains an error message "mkdir: cannot create directory ‘./outputs’: File exists". This error indicates that there was an attempt to create a directory named 'outputs' in the current directory, but it already exists, which is not an error in itself but rather an expected condition. However, the subsequent command "rm -f src/main.o src/account.o src/expressage.o src/logistics.o" suggests that the script was intended to clean up previously compiled files, which implies that the directory creation failure might be a side effect of a previous run that didn't clean up properly. This could lead to subsequent errors if the script assumes that the files do not exist. Therefore, the presence of this error and the implied assumption of a clean build environment suggests that the log contains errors or potential issues that need attention.
