Class: Defective

Reason: The log contains several lines that indicate errors or issues occurred during the execution of the script. For example, the command `rm -rf obj` is used to remove the directory `obj`, which is typically used for storing object files and other intermediate build products. This suggests that the script attempted to clean the build directory but encountered an error, possibly due to permission issues or the directory not existing.

Additionally, the subsequent commands to create the `obj` directory and compile the code are mentioned, but the log does not provide any output indicating whether these commands were successful. The presence of error-related commands and the lack of successful completion indicators suggest that the log is for a defective or problematic execution scenario.
