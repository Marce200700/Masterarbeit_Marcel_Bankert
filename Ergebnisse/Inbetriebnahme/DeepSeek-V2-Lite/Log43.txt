Class: Defective

Reason: The log contains an error message "mkdir: cannot create directory ‘./outputs’: File exists" and "mkdir: cannot create directory ‘./outputs/test001’: File exists", which indicates that the directory creation failed due to the directories already existing. This suggests an issue with the script or the environment in which it is running, leading to the classification as 'Defective'.
