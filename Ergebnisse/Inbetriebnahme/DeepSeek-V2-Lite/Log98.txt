Classified as: Defective

Reason: The log contains several critical issues and errors that indicate a failed build and a failing test. The error message "RedisCacheAcceptanceTest > testPutAndGet() FAILED redis.clients.jedis.exceptions.JedisConnectionException at RedisCacheAcceptanceTest.java:28" suggests that there is a problem with the Redis connection, which is likely due to the absence of the 'redis-cli' command, indicating that Redis is not installed or not properly configured. Additionally, the log mentions "BUILD FAILED in 1s" and "FAILURE: Build failed with an exception," which clearly indicates a build failure. Therefore, the log is classified as 'Defective' because it shows that the system is not functioning correctly and there are errors present.
