Class: Defective

Reason: The log contains errors, specifically the text "Text Reading Time (in text): 1 min HTML Reading Time (in text): 1 min Markdown Reading Time (in text): 1 min Custom WPM: 5" suggests that the reading times are incorrectly calculated as 1 minute each, which is not possible given the short content. This indicates a potential error in the script.
