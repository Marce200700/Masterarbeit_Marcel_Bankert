Class: Ok

Reason: The log does not contain any errors or warnings. It shows that the setup_shell_script.sh script successfully installed the required packages (pytest, iniconfig, pluggy, exceptiongroup, tomli, and pytest) for the project. The installation was done using a user installation method because the normal site-packages directory was not writeable. The log also confirms that the scripts py.test and pytest are installed in the user's local bin directory, and it provides instructions on how to add this directory to the PATH to ensure the scripts can be run from any terminal.
