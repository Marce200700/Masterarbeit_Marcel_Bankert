Classifier: Defective

Reason: The log contains several warnings and errors related to unsupported engines, unknown custom elements, and Handlebars access denied errors. These issues indicate that the application or its dependencies are not compatible with the Node.js version being used (v12.22.9). This can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior, making the log defective.
