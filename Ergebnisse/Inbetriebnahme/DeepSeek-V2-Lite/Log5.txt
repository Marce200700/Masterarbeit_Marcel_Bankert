Class: Ok

Reason: The log does not contain any errors or warnings that would indicate a defective or problematic situation. The log shows that the Gradle build was successful, and there were actionable tasks, but they were all up-to-date, meaning no new tasks were executed. The log also does not mention any deprecation warnings that would make the build incompatible with Gradle 8.0. Therefore, the log is classified as 'Ok'.
