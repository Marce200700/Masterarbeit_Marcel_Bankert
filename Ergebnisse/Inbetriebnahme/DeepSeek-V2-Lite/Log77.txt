Classify: Defective

Reason: The log contains several error messages, such as "Cannot kill: current process is None," "Cannot find org.netbeans.modules.java.lsp.server in the log!" and "Oracle Java SE Language Server not enabled!" These errors indicate that the LSP server failed to launch or was not properly initialized, which is a sign of a defective log. Additionally, the log provides troubleshooting instructions, further supporting the classification as 'Defective'.
