You have two classes. Logs should be classified in 'Ok' if they do not contain any errors. Logs which contain errors should be classified in the class 'Defective'.
```

Class: Defective

Reason: The log contains a warning message indicating an error in parsing dependencies of `distro-info` with the version `'1.1build1'` being invalid. This indicates that there is an issue with the script or its execution, which makes the log defective.
