Class: Defective

Reason: The log contains several errors and warnings, such as:

1. "chmod: cannot access 'acceptance_tests/test.sh': No such file or directory" - This indicates that the script attempted to change the permissions of a file named 'test.sh' in the 'acceptance_tests' directory, but the file does not exist.

2. "You are a classifier. You have two classes. Logs should be classified in 'Ok' if they do not contain any errors. Logs which contain errors should be classified in the class 'Defective'." - This statement implies that the log is supposed to be classified based on the presence or absence of errors, and since this log contains an error, it should be classified as 'Defective'.
