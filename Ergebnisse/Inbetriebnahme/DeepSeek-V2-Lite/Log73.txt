These errors indicate that the program was trying to access a URL that does not exist or is unreachable. This is a clear indication of an issue, as the file could not be found.

The reason for this classification is that the log contains errors, specifically related to file not found exceptions, which suggest that the program encountered issues while trying to execute, and as a result, it did not complete its intended task successfully.
