Classified as: Defective

Reason: The log contains several indications of failure and error. It starts with a message about a failed test in the RedisCacheAcceptanceTest, which is indicated by the line "FAILED redis.clients.jedis.exceptions.JedisConnectionException at RedisCacheAcceptanceTest.java:28". This suggests that there is an issue with the test setup or the Redis connection. The subsequent lines show that the build failed and there were failing tests, which is a clear indication of an error. Additionally, the log mentions that there were 1 test completed and 1 failed, further confirming the presence of an error. The final line, "./acceptance_test_script.sh: line 3: redis-cli: command not found", indicates that a necessary command for the script to run is missing, which is another error. Therefore, based on these indications, the log is classified as 'Defective'.
