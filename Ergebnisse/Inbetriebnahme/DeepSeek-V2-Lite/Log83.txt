Class: Defective

Reason: The log contains a failure message indicating that one of the tests failed. Specifically, the test_country_mentions function did not produce the expected result. The expected result was a dictionary with specific key-value pairs, but the actual result was an OrderedDict with different key-value pairs. This indicates an issue with the implementation of the function, which is an error. Therefore, the log is classified as 'Defective'.
