The log shows the execution of a shell script named 'run.sh' which compiles a C++ program using g++ compiler. The script removes the object files before compilation and then compiles the source files 'main.cpp', 'Shape.cpp', and 'Rectangle.cpp' into an executable named 'area_calculation'. The flags '-fprofile-arcs' and '-ftest-coverage' are used for profiling and code coverage analysis respectively.

Based on the information provided in the log, it appears that the compilation process was executed successfully without any errors. The removal of object files before compilation is a common practice to ensure a clean build. Therefore, the log can be classified as 'Ok'.
