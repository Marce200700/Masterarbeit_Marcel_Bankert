The log indicates that a Gradle build was successful, and it reports the execution times for various heap operations using two different heap implementations: Leftist Heap and Fibonacci Heap. Since there are no error messages or indications of failures in the log, it can be classified as 'Ok'. The reason for this classification is that the log does not contain any errors or issues that would prevent the system from functioning properly.
