Class: Defective

Reason: The log indicates that the user is encountering a permission denied error when attempting to run a script named "unit_test_script.sh". This error typically occurs when the user does not have the necessary permissions to execute the script. In this case, the script file itself may not have the execute permission set for the user, or the user may not have the necessary permissions to access the directory containing the script. Either way, this error indicates a problem that needs to be addressed before the script can be run successfully.
