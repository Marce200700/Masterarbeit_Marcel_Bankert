Based on the log, the build was successful, and no errors were reported. However, the log contains a deprecation warning. Deprecation warnings are not errors, but they indicate that certain features or methods are no longer recommended and will be removed in a future version of Gradle. In this case, the build is still functional, and the deprecation warnings do not prevent it from running. Therefore, the log can be classified as 'Ok'. The reason for this classification is that the build was successful, and no errors were reported, despite the presence of deprecation warnings.
