 The log is classified as 'Defective'. The error message indicates that the command 'tar openjdk-14_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz' did not complete successfully with exit code 2. This suggests that there was an issue with the tar command, possibly due to an incorrect usage of the 'b' option. The correct command to extract the tarball would be 'tar xf openjdk-14_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz'. Therefore, the log is classified as 'Defective' because it contains an error that needs to be addressed before the Docker image can be built successfully.
