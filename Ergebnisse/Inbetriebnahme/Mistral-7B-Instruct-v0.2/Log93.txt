Based on the log, it appears that the build was successful, but there were deprecated features used in the Gradle build script, making it incompatible with Gradle 8.0. However, the build still completed successfully. The last part of the log shows a FileNotFoundException error when trying to open a URL to retrieve an image file.

The 'Ok' class would be the correct classification for this log because the build was successful, even though there were deprecated features used. The error regarding the FileNotFoundException is not related to the build process itself, but rather an issue with retrieving an image file during the execution of the code. This error does not prevent the build from completing successfully, so it should not affect the classification.

However, it is important to note that the FileNotFoundException error should be addressed in the code to ensure that the image files can be correctly retrieved and processed. This error may cause issues in the future if not resolved.
