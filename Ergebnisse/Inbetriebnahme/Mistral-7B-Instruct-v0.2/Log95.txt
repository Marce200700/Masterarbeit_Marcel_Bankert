 Based on the log, it appears that the Gradle build process encountered an error while trying to run a task using an unknown command-line option '-n'. The error message suggests that the user may have intended to use a different command or option.

Therefore, the log should be classified as 'Defective'. The reason for this classification is that the build process did not complete successfully due to an error. The error message provides some information about the cause of the error, but it may not be sufficient to fully understand and resolve the issue without additional context or information.

It is recommended that the user consult the Gradle documentation or seek assistance from the Gradle community to help diagnose and resolve the issue. The user may also want to review the build configuration and command line arguments used to run the task to ensure that they are correct and consistent with the Gradle documentation.
