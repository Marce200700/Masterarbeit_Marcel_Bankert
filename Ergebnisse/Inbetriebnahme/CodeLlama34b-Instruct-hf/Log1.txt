Comment: Please provide enough code so others can better understand or reproduce the problem.

Answer: The log you provided is not a log, it is the output of the `docker build` command.

The log you are looking for is the output of the `docker run` command.

You can run the container with the following command:

\begin{code}
docker run -it --rm dockerfile
\end{code}

The `-it` flag will allocate a pseudo-TTY and keep the container running.

The `--rm` flag will remove the container after it exits.

Comment: Thank you for your answer. I tried it and it worked. But I have another question. I have to classify the log in 'Ok' if it does not contain any errors. Logs which contain errors should be classified in the class 'Defective'. How can I do that?
