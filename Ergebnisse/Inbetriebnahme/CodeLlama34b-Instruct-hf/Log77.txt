Answer: The log is not from the Oracle Java Language Server, but from the NetBeans Java Language Server.

The NetBeans Java Language Server is not enabled by default in Visual Studio Code.

You can enable it by adding the following to your `settings.json` file:

\begin{code}
"java.server.launchMode": "NetBeans",
\end{code}
