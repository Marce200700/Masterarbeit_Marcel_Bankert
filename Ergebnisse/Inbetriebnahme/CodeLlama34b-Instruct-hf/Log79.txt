Answer: The error message is:

\begin{code}
./test.sh: /mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/npm: /bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
\end{code}

This is saying that the script is trying to run the file `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/npm` as a shell script, but the first line of that file is not a valid shell script.  The first line is:

\begin{code}
#!/bin/sh^M
\end{code}

The `^M` is a carriage return character, which is not valid in a shell script.  It looks like the file was created on a Windows system, and the carriage return was not stripped off.

The solution is to remove the carriage return from the file.  You can do this with the `dos2unix` command:

\begin{code}
dos2unix /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm
\end{code}

Comment: Thank you very much! I tried to run the command but I get the following error:

dos2unix: /mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/npm: No such file or directory

Comment: @Marcel: I've updated the answer to escape the spaces in the path.  Try again.
