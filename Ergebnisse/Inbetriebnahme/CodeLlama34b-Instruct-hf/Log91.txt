Answer: The error message is pretty clear:

\begin{code}
CondaValueError: too few arguments, must supply command line package specs or --file

You are missing the package name to install.

Comment: I have added the package name but still the same error.

Comment: @MarcelKlein: Please update your question with the new Dockerfile and the new error message.
