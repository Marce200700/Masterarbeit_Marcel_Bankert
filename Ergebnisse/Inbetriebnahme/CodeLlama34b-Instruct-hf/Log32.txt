Answer: The log is from a python script that is trying to install a package called `stocktrends`. The package is not found in the default location, so it tries to install it from a tarball.

The log shows that the installation was successful.

Comment: Thank you for your answer. I have another question. What does the line "WARNING: Error parsing dependencies of distro-info: Invalid version: '1.1build1'" mean?

Comment: It means that the version number of the package `distro-info` is not in a format that can be parsed by the package manager.
