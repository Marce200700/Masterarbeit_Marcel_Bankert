Answer: The log is classified as 'Defective' because it contains the following error:

\begin{code}
Defaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable
\end{code}

This error is caused by the fact that the user does not have the necessary permissions to write to the `site-packages` directory. This is a common problem when using a package manager like `pip` to install packages.

The reason for this error is that the user is trying to install a package in a directory that is not writable by the user. This is usually caused by the fact that the user is trying to install a package in a directory that is owned by the root user, and the user does not have the necessary permissions to write to that directory.

To fix this error, the user should use the `--user` flag when installing packages. This flag tells `pip` to install the package in the user's home directory, which is usually writable by the user. For example:

\begin{code}
pip install --user readtime
\end{code}

This command will install the `readtime` package in the user's home directory, which should fix the error.
