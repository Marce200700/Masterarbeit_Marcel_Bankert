 The log contains the following error: 'rm: cannot remove 'obj': Is a directory'. This error is caused by the fact that the directory 'obj' is not empty. The command 'rm -rf obj' tries to remove the directory 'obj' and all its content. However, the directory is not empty, so the command fails. The reason for the chosen class is 'Defective'.
