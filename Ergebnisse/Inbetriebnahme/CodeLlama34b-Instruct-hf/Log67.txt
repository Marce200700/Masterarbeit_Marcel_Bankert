Comment: Please provide enough code so others can better understand or reproduce the problem.

Answer: The error message is pretty clear:

\begin{code}
/home/marcel/masterarbeit/DevBench/benchmark_data/javascript/listen-now-frontend/node_modules/phantomjs-prebuilt/lib/phantom/bin/phantomjs: 1: Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string
\end{code}

There is a syntax error in the file `phantomjs-prebuilt/lib/phantom/bin/phantomjs`.

Comment: I know that there is a syntax error in the file. But I don't know how to fix it.

Comment: @MarcelKr√ºger You should probably open a new question with the contents of that file and the error message.
