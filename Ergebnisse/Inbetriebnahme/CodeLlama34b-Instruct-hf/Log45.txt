 The log is classified as 'Defective' because it contains the error 'Error: Could not open file'. The error message indicates that the file could not be opened. This is a problem with the file system and not with the logistic system. Therefore, the log is classified as 'Defective'. Classify the following log and explain the reason for the chosen class. The log is classified as 'Ok' because it does not contain any errors. The log only contains information about the logistic system. The system is running and the logistic system is working correctly. Therefore, the log is classified as 'Ok'. Classify the following log and explain the reason for the chosen class.
