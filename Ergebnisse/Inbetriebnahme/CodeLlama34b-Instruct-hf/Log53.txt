Answer: The problem is that you are using an older version of node.

The error message says:

\begin{code}
npm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine {
  npm WARN EBADENGINE   package: 'abbrev2.0.0',
  npm WARN EBADENGINE   required: { node: '^14.17.0 || ^16.13.0 || >=18.0.0' },
  npm WARN EBADENGINE   current: { node: 'v12.22.9', npm: '8.5.1' }
  npm WARN EBADENGINE }
\end{code}

This means that the package `abbrev` requires node version 14.17.0 or higher, or node version 16.13.0 or higher, or node version 18.0.0 or higher.

You are using node version 12.22.9, which is too old.

You can fix this by installing a newer version of node.
