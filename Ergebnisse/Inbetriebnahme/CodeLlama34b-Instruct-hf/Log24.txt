\begin{code}
E: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/p/python3.10/libpython3.10-minimal_3.10.4-1+focal2_amd64.deb  Could not open file /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/libpython3.10-minimal_3.10.4-1+focal2_amd64.deb - open (2: No such file or directory) [IP: 91.189.88.152 80]
\end{code}

This error is caused by the fact that the package `libpython3.10-minimal` is not available in the repository.
