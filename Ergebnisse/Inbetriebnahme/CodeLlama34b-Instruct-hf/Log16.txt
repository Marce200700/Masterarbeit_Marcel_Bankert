Comment: Please provide enough code so others can better understand or reproduce the problem.

Answer: I think you are using the wrong command.

\begin{code}
npm install
\end{code}

is used to install the dependencies of a project.

\begin{code}
npm install -g <package>
\end{code}

is used to install a package globally.

You can try to install the package locally with

\begin{code}
npm install <package>
\end{code}
