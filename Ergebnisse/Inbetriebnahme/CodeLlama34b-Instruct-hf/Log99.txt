Comment: Please provide enough code so others can better understand or reproduce the problem.

Answer: The error message is pretty clear:

\begin{code}
redis.clients.jedis.exceptions.JedisConnectionException: Failed to connect to any host resolved for DNS name.
\end{code}

It means that the application is trying to connect to a Redis server, but it cannot find any server to connect to.

The reason is that the application is trying to connect to a Redis server using the hostname `redis`, but there is no such hostname in your network.

You need to either:
\begin{itemize}
\item Install a Redis server on your machine and configure it to listen on the `redis` hostname.
\item Configure the application to connect to a different Redis server.
\end{itemize}
