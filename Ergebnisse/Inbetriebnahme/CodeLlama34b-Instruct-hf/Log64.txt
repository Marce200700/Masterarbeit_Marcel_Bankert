Answer: The log you provided is not a log, it is the output of the `docker build` command.

The log you are looking for is the output of the `docker run` command.

You can use the `-t` option to specify the name of the container.

\begin{code}
docker run -t my-container
\end{code}

You can also use the `--rm` option to automatically remove the container when it exits.

\begin{code}
docker run --rm my-container
\end{code}

Comment: Thank you for your answer. I am new to docker and I am not sure if I understand you correctly. I am not looking for the output of the docker run command. I am looking for the output of the docker build command. I want to know if the build was successful or not.

Comment: @Marcel The output of the `docker build` command is the output you provided. It is not a log, it is the output of the command. The log of the build is the output of the commands that are executed during the build.

Comment: @Marcel If you want to know if the build was successful or not, you can check the exit code of the `docker build` command. If the exit code is 0, the build was successful. If the exit code is not 0, the build failed.
