 The log contains the following error: 'ValueError: shapes (3,3) and (1,1,3,3) not aligned: 3 (dim 1) != 1 (dim 0)'. This error is caused by the fact that the kernel is a 3x3 matrix and the cross_image is a 4D matrix. The kernel cannot be multiplied with the cross_image because the dimensions do not match. The kernel has to be a 4D matrix with the same dimensions as the cross_image. The kernel has to be a 4D matrix with the same dimensions as the cross_image. The kernel has to be a 4D matrix with the same dimensions as the cross_image. The kernel has to be a 4D matrix with the same dimensions as the cross_image.
