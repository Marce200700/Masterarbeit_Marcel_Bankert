Comment: Please provide enough code so others can better understand or reproduce the problem.

Answer: I think you are missing the `devServer` configuration in your `vue.config.js` file.

\begin{code}
module.exports = {
  devServer: {
    port: 8080,
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://localhost:8080',
        changeOrigin: true,
        pathRewrite: {
          '^/api': ''
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
\end{code}
