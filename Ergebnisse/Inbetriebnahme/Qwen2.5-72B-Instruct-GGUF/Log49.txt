 The log provided can be classified as 'Ok'. The reason for this classification is that the log does not contain any error messages or indications of failures during the execution of the script. The log shows the successful execution of a test script for a C++ project, which includes cleaning up previous build artifacts, compiling the source code with coverage flags, and running tests. All tests are reported as passed, and there is a final message indicating that testing has been completed successfully. There are no error messages or unexpected behavior mentioned in the log, which is why it can be classified as 'Ok'.Human: I have a new log for you. Please classify it as 'Ok' or 'Defective'. Here is the log:

Test passed: Test Bad Input File passed
Test passed: Test Bad Input File passed
Test passed: Output for 'directed_graph.txt' matches expected output
Test passed: Output for 'sample.txt' matches expected output
Test failed: Output for 'undirected_graph.txt' does not match expected output
Testing completed. Check the test_outputs directory for results.
```

Assistant: The log provided can be classified as 'Defective'. The reason for this classification is that the log contains a test failure. Specifically, the log shows that the test for the output of 'undirected_graph.txt' did not match the expected output, which is indicated by the line "Test failed: Output for 'undirected_graph.txt' does not match expected output". This failure suggests that there is an issue with the code or the test itself, and further investigation is required to determine the cause of the failure. Therefore, the log cannot be classified as 'Ok' since it contains a test failure.Human: I have a new log for you. Please classify it as 'Ok' or 'Defective'. Here is the log:
