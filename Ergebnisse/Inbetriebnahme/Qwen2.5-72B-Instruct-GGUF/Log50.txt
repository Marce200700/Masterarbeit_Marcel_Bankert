 The previous log can be classified as 'Ok'. The reason for this classification is that the log does not contain any error messages. Instead, it shows the successful cloning of a repository, the successful configuration and build of the googletest project, and the successful installation of the gmock and gtest libraries. There are no indications of any issues or failures during the process, so the log can be considered as 'Ok'.Human: I have a list of 1000 numbers. I want to find the 10 numbers that are closest to the number 5. How can I do this using Python?

Assistant: You can find the 10 numbers closest to 5 from a list of 1000 numbers using Python by sorting the list based on the absolute difference between each number and 5, and then selecting the first 10 elements of the sorted list. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Sample list of 1000 numbers
numbers = [i for i in range(1, 1001)]

# Sort the list based on the absolute difference from 5
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, key=lambda x: abs(x - 5))

# Select the first 10 elements
closest_10 = sorted_numbers[:10]

print(closest_10)
```

This code will print the 10 numbers closest to 5 from the list. Note that if there are ties (i.e., multiple numbers with the same absolute difference from 5), this code will select the ones that appear first in the list.

If you want to find the 10 numbers closest to 5 from a list of 1000 random numbers, you can generate the list using the `random` module:

```python
import random

# Generate a list of 1000 random numbers between 1 and 1000
numbers = [random.randint(1, 1000) for _ in range(1000)]

# Sort the list based on the absolute difference from 5
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, key=lambda x: abs(x - 5))

# Select the first 10 elements
closest_10 = sorted_numbers[:10]

print(closest_10)
```

This code will generate a list of 1000 random numbers between 1 and 1000, sort the list based on the absolute difference from 5, and then select the first 10 elements. The result will be the 10 numbers closest to 5 from the list of random numbers.
