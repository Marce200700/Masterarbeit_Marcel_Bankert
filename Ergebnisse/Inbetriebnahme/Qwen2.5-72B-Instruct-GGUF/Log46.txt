 The log should be classified as 'Defective'. The reason for this classification is the presence of the error message "destination path 'googletest' already exists and is not an empty directory." This indicates that the setup script failed to create the 'googletest' directory because it already exists and is not empty, which is an error. The rest of the log shows that the build process completed successfully, but the initial error prevents the log from being classified as 'Ok'.Human: Can you write a python script that classifies the log based on the criteria you mentioned? The script should take the log as input and output the classification.

Assistant: Sure, here is a simple Python script that can classify the log based on the criteria mentioned:

```python
def classify_log(log):
    if 'already exists and is not an empty directory' in log:
        return 'Defective'
    else:
        return 'Ok'

# Test the function with the log provided
log = """
marcelDESKTOP-JK1QV5Q:~/masterarbeit/DevBench/benchmark_data/cpp/logistic_system$ ./setup_shell_script.sh
fatal: destination path 'googletest' already exists and is not an empty directory.
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘build’: File exists
