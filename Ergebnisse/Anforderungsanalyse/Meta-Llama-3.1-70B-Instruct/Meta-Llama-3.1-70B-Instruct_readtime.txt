Introduction:
Readtime is a software program designed to estimate the reading time of various types of content, including plain text, HTML, and markdown formats. The program aims to provide realistic estimates by considering both the complexity and length of the input texts.

Goals:
The primary goals of the Readtime program are:

* To accurately estimate the reading time of different types of content
* To provide realistic estimates by considering both complexity and length of the input texts
* To handle various input formats, including plain text, HTML, and markdown
* To provide proper exception handling for unsupported input formats
* To implement the program using Python 3.x and relevant libraries

Features and Functionalities:
The Readtime program will have the following features and functionalities:

* Three separate functions for processing plain text, HTML, and markdown input formats
* Each function will return the estimated readtime as a string in a human-readable format
* A simple heuristic to determine complexity based on average sentence length
* Three categories of complexity: low, medium, and high
* Calculation of readtime based on complexity category and words-per-minute rate
* Ability to count the number of sentences, words, and characters in the input text
* Ability to handle punctuation and different input formats

Supporting Data Description:
The program will use the following data to estimate the reading time:

* Input text in plain text, HTML, or markdown format
* Complexity category (low, medium, or high) determined by average sentence length
* Words-per-minute rate (200 wpm for low complexity, 150 wpm for medium complexity, and 100 wpm for high complexity)

Technical Constraints:
The program will be implemented using Python 3.x and the following libraries:

* beautifulsoup4 for HTML parsing
* lxml for HTML parsing
* markdown2 for markdown parsing
* pyquery for HTML parsing
* pytest for testing

Requirements:
The program will have the following requirements:

* The input text must be in plain text, HTML, or markdown format
* The program must be able to handle punctuation and different input formats
* The program must provide proper exception handling for unsupported input formats
* The program must use the specified libraries and technologies

Usage:
The program can be used by calling the respective function for the input format, passing the input text as an argument. For example:

* `readtime_plain_text("This is a sample plain text.")`
* `readtime_html("<p>This is a sample HTML text.</p>")`
* `readtime_markdown("# This is a sample markdown text.")`

Acceptance Criteria:
The program will be considered acceptable if it meets the following criteria:

* The program accurately estimates the reading time for different types of content
* The program handles various input formats correctly
* The program provides proper exception handling for unsupported input formats
* The program uses the specified libraries and technologies
* The program passes all unit tests and integration tests.
