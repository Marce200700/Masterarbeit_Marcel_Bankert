Introduction
------------

The Hybrid-Images program is designed to generate hybrid images by combining two input images using various image processing and filtering techniques. The program aims to create a visually coherent merged image, making it an efficient tool for image manipulation.

Goals
-----

The primary goals of the Hybrid-Images program are:

*   To generate hybrid images by merging two input images using different image processing and filtering techniques.
*   To provide a user-friendly interface that is easy to understand and navigate for non-experts.
*   To ensure the code is easy to expand and maintain, allowing for future feature additions.

Features and Functionalities
---------------------------

The Hybrid-Images program will include the following features and functionalities:

*   Image input: Users can upload two images as input.
*   Image processing and filtering techniques: The program will utilize cross-correlation, convolution, Gaussian blur, high-pass-filters, and low-pass-filters to merge the input images.
*   Hybrid image generation: The program will generate a visually coherent merged image based on the selected techniques and input images.
*   GUI: A user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) will be implemented using a Python library like Tkinter or PyQt.
*   Expandability: The code will be designed to be easy to expand and maintain, allowing for future feature additions.

Technical Requirements
----------------------

The Hybrid-Images program will be implemented using the following technical requirements:

*   Programming language: Python
*   External libraries: NumPy and OpenCV for image processing tasks
*   GUI library: Tkinter or PyQt
