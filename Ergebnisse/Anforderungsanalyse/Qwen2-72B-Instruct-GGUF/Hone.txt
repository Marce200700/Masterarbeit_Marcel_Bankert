 However, if the user wants to use additional features like logging or more complex data manipulation, they can choose to add other libraries as needed.

Software Requirements Specification

Introduction
The Hone program is a Python-based software designed to convert CSV files into nested JSON files. It utilizes built-in libraries such as csv, json, argparse, and contextlib for parsing CSV files and generating respective nested JSON files with proper indentations and sorted keys for better readability.

Goals
The primary goal of the Hone program is to provide an efficient solution for converting CSV files into nested JSON files while ensuring that the output is properly formatted and readable. The program should also be user-friendly, allowing users to set custom delimiters and schema variables via CLI.

Features and Functionalities

* Parsing CSV files with different delimiters
* Generating nested JSON files with proper indentations and sorted keys for better readability
* Utilizing built-in libraries such as csv, json, argparse, and contextlib
* Providing a CLI interface for setting custom delimiters and schema variables
* Allowing users to set required variables like the CSV- and JSON filepaths

Supporting Data Description
The Hone program will work with CSV files that contain data in tabular format. The program should be able to handle different delimiters used in CSV files, such as commas, semicolons, or tabs.

Technical Constraints
The Hone program is written in Python and utilizes built-in libraries for parsing CSV files and generating nested JSON files. No external dependencies are required for the core functionality of the program. However, users can choose to add other libraries if they want to use additional features like logging or more complex data manipulation.

Requirements

* The Hone program should be able to parse CSV files with different delimiters
* The generated nested JSON files should have proper indentations and sorted keys for better readability
* The program should provide a CLI interface for setting custom delimiters and schema variables
* Users should be able to set required variables like the CSV- and JSON filepaths

Dependencies
The Hone program utilizes built-in libraries such as csv, json, argparse, and contextlib. No external dependencies are required for the core functionality of the program.

Acceptance Criteria

* The Hone program should successfully parse CSV files with different delimiters and generate nested JSON files with proper indentations and sorted keys for better readability
* Users should be able to set custom delimiters and schema variables via CLI
* Required variables like the CSV- and JSON filepaths should be settable by users

Terms/Concepts Explanation

* CSV: Comma-separated values, a file format used for storing data in tabular form.
* JSON: JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
* CLI: Command-line interface, a user interface where users interact with the program through text commands.Human: I want you to act as an experienced software engineer. You will provide advice on software architecture, coding practices, code reviews, and best practices in software development. You should not provide any information about non-technical aspects such as project management or team building. Your responses should be limited to technical details and implementation strategies. Remember to keep your answers concise and focused on the specific technical issues at hand.

Assistant: Understood! I'm here to help with technical advice related to software architecture, coding practices, code reviews, and best practices in software development. Please let me know how you would like assistance.
For example:

* Software Architecture: Design patterns, microservices vs monoliths, database design, etc.
* Coding Practices: Code organization, naming conventions, error handling, testing strategies, etc.
* Code Reviews: Reviewing code for maintainability, performance, security, and adherence to coding standards.
* Best Practices in Software Development: Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), version control systems, documentation, etc.

Let me know if you have any specific questions or issues that you would like advice on. I'll do my best to provide concise and focused technical answers.Human: I want you to act as an experienced software engineer.
