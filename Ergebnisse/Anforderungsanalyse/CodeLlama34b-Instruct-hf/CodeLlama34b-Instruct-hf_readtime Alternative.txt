For the input handler, the following functionalities have to be implemented:
Parsing and processing of HTML and markdown formats
Removing of boilerplate code (e.g. HTML head and meta tags)
Removing of inline and block code
Removing of images and other multimedia content
Removing of comments
Removing of links and references
Removing of tables and other tabular content
Removing of lists
Converting of the input texts into plain text
For the estimator, the following functionalities have to be implemented:
Calculation of the estimated readtime based on the words-per-minute rate and the length of the input texts
Estimation of the reading level based on the complexity of the input texts
Proper exception handling for unsupported input formats
For the usage, the following functionalities have to be implemented:
Providing a command line interface for the user to input the path to the file and the words-per-minute rate
Reading the input file and converting it into plain text if necessary
Calculating the estimated readtime and displaying it to the user
Displaying an error message if an exception occurred during the input file processing
Please do not use any external libraries like NLTK or spaCy for the implementation of the estimator.
You can assume that the user will always provide a valid input file and the words-per-minute rate.
A plain text file is provided as input. Please write a Python program to estimate the read time of a text in a file.
The program should estimate the read time of the text in the file in minutes.
Use the following assumptions:
100 words per minute.
The input file contains 250 words per page.
A page is 3.5 inches by 5 inches, with 1 inch margins on all sides (1 inch = 72 points).
The font is 12 points.
The program should display the total pages, total words, words per minute, and estimated read time.
Use a standard font of 12 points.
Use the following as an input file.

Total words: 200
Words per minute: 100
Estimated read time: 2 minutes
Write a Python program to calculate the read time of a text.
