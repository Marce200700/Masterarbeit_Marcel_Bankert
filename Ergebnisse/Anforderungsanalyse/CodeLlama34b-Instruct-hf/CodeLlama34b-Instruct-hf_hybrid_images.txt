
The goal of this project is to create a hybrid image generator using different image processing techniques. The program should be able to generate a visually coherent hybrid image from two input images.
Features and Functionalities:
The program should have the following features:
- Cross-correlation
- Convolution
- Gaussian blur
- High-pass filter
- Low-pass filter
- Hybrid image generation
Technical Requirements:
The program should be implemented in Python. The following external libraries can be used for image processing tasks: NumPy and OpenCV.
Requirements:
The program should have the following requirements:
- The input images should be of the same size.
- The output image should be visually coherent to the two input images.
Usage:
The program should be able to generate a hybrid image from two input images. The user should be able to choose which technique is used for the generation of the hybrid image.
Acceptance Criteria:
The program should meet the following acceptance criteria:
- The output image should be visually coherent to the two input images.
- The program should be able to generate a hybrid image from two input images using different techniques.
- The program should be implemented in Python.
- The program should use NumPy and OpenCV for image processing tasks.
