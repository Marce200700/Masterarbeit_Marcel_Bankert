 The estimated readtime should be displayed in minutes and seconds (e.g., 5:45). 

**Software Requirement Specification: ReadTime**

### Introduction
ReadTime is a Python-based application that accurately estimates the reading time of various content formats, considering both text length and complexity. It supports plain text, HTML, and Markdown inputs, providing user-friendly error handling for unsupported formats.

### Goals
1. **Accurate estimation**: Provide reliable reading time estimates based on words-per-minute rate, incorporating text complexity and length.
2. **Multi-format support**: Seamlessly process plain text, HTML, and Markdown inputs using efficient libraries (BeautifulSoup4, lxml, markdown2, pyquery).
3. **Robust error handling**: Gracefully handle unsupported formats (e.g., TeX-Code, AsciiDoc) with informative error messages for users.
4. **Intuitive output**: Display estimated reading time in minutes and seconds (e.g., 5:45).

### Features and Functionalities
1. **Format-agnostic parsing**: Efficiently parse plain text, HTML, and Markdown inputs using specialized libraries.
2. **Complexity-aware estimation**: Integrate a sophisticated algorithm considering both text length and complexity to generate accurate reading time estimates.
3. **Error handling and feedback**: Catch unsupported formats, providing concise, informative error messages for users.

### Supporting Data Description
* **Input formats**: Plain text, HTML, Markdown
* **Output format**: Estimated reading time (minutes:seconds, e.g., 5:45)
* **Algorithmic considerations**:
	+ Words-per-minute rate
	+ Text complexity metrics (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning-Fog Index)

### Technical Constraints
1. **Implementation language**: Python 3.x
2. **Dependent libraries**: BeautifulSoup4, lxml, markdown2, pyquery
3. **Testing framework**: Pytest

### Requirements
**Functional Requirements**
1. The application shall accurately estimate reading time for plain text, HTML, and Markdown inputs.
2. The estimation algorithm shall incorporate both text length and complexity.
3. The application shall display estimated reading time in minutes and seconds (e.g., 5:45).
4. When encountering unsupported formats (e.g., TeX-Code, AsciiDoc), the application shall raise informative error messages.

**Non-Functional Requirements**
1. **Performance**: Efficient parsing and estimation for inputs of varying sizes.
2. **Robustness**: Comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages for unsupported formats.

### Usage
Users provide input content in supported formats (plain text, HTML, Markdown). ReadTime processes the input, applying its complexity-aware algorithm to generate an accurate estimated reading time, displayed in minutes and seconds. If an unsupported format is detected, a concise, informative error message is presented.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Accuracy**:
	* Estimated reading times for diverse inputs (plain text, HTML, Markdown) closely match human-annotated benchmarks.
	* Complexity metrics effectively influence estimation, reflecting varying text difficulties.
2. **Format support and error handling**:
	* Successful processing of supported formats (plain text, HTML, Markdown).
	* Informative error messages for unsupported formats (e.g., TeX-Code, AsciiDoc), with clear format identification.
3. **Output and usability**:
	* Consistent, intuitive output format (minutes:seconds, e.g., 5:45).
	* Error messages are concise, descriptive, and user-friendly.
4. **Performance and robustness**:
	* Efficient handling of large inputs, with reasonable response times (< 5 seconds for 10,000-word documents).
	* Comprehensive error handling maintains application stability under diverse, invalid, or malformed inputs.
