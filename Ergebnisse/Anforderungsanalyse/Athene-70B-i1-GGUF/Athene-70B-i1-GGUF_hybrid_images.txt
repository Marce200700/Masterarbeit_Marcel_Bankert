### Introduction
The Hybrid-Images program generates visually coherent hybrid images by combining two input images using advanced image processing and filtering techniques, including cross-correlation, convolution, Gaussian blur, high-pass filters, and low-pass filters. Implemented in Python, this software leverages NumPy and OpenCV libraries for efficient image processing.

### Goals
1. **Coherent Hybrid Images**: Produce visually appealing hybrid images that effectively merge characteristics of both input images.
2. **Flexibility and Customizability**: Offer a range of filtering techniques to accommodate diverse use cases and artistic visions.
3. **Efficient Implementation**: Optimize performance using NumPy and OpenCV, ensuring rapid processing for high-resolution inputs.

### Features and Functionalities
1. **Hybrid Image Generation**:
	* Accept two input images (arbitrary dimensions and formats).
	* Apply configurable filtering techniques: cross-correlation, convolution, Gaussian blur, high-pass filters, and low-pass filters.
	* Produce a visually coherent hybrid image as output.
2. **Filter Customization**: Expose intuitive parameters for each filter type, enabling fine-grained control over the merging process.
3. **Real-time Preview** (optional): Provide an interactive preview to facilitate rapid experimentation and refinement.

### Technical Requirements
1. **Implementation Language**: Python 3.x (latest stable version).
2. **Dependencies**:
	* NumPy (latest stable version) for efficient numerical computations.
	* OpenCV (latest stable version) for optimized image processing primitives.
3. **Platform Compatibility**: Develop for cross-platform compatibility, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Requirements
1. **Input Validation**:
	* Verify input images are valid, correctly formatted, and have compatible dimensions.
	* Gracefully handle invalid or malformed inputs with informative error messages.
2. **Filter Chain Management**:
	* Implement a modular filter architecture, allowing seamless combination and reordering of techniques.
	* Ensure thread-safe, efficient execution of filter chains to minimize processing latency.
3. **Output Quality and Fidelity**:
	* Preserve input image metadata (e.g., EXIF) in the generated hybrid image.
	* Support output formats matching input types (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF).

### Usage
1. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Offer a concise, scriptable CLI for automation and integration:
	* `hybrid_images --input-1 image_a.jpg --input-2 image_b.png --filter-chain gauss-blur,cross-correlate --output hybrid_result.jpg`
2. **Optional Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provide an intuitive, interactive GUI for exploratory users, featuring:
	* Visual filter chain construction and parameter adjustment.
	* Real-time preview updates reflecting filter modifications.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Visual Coherence**: Hybrid images demonstrate a clear, aesthetically pleasing fusion of input characteristics, as assessed through human evaluation (mean opinion score ≥ 4/5).
2. **Performance**:
	* Process 4K-resolution inputs (< 10 seconds) and HD-resolution inputs (< 2 seconds) on mid-range hardware.
	* Maintain responsive GUI interaction (≤ 500 ms latency) during filter adjustments, if implemented.
3. **Robustness and Correctness**:
	* Successfully handle diverse input formats, sizes, and filter combinations without errors or artifacts.
	* Consistently preserve input metadata and produce valid output files conforming to specified formats.

By satisfying these requirements, the Hybrid-Images program will empower users to craft captivating, information-rich hybrid images while showcasing Python's versatility in high-performance image processing.
