## Software Requirement Specification: Hybrid-Images

### Introduction

This document outlines the software requirements for the Hybrid-Images program, a Python application designed to generate hybrid images using various image processing and filtering techniques.

### Goals

The primary goal of the Hybrid-Images program is to provide a user-friendly tool for creating visually coherent hybrid images from two distinct input images. This will be achieved through the implementation of several image processing techniques, ensuring a seamless blend of features from both source images.

### Features and Functionalities

The Hybrid-Images program will offer the following features and functionalities:

* **Hybrid Image Generation:** The core functionality is generating hybrid images by combining two input images.

* **Image Input:** The program will accept two images as input, allowing users to select the images they wish to combine.

* **Image Processing Techniques:** The program will employ the following image processing techniques for hybrid image generation:
    * **Cross-Correlation:** To identify and align similar features between the two input images.
    * **Convolution:** To apply filters and modify image features for seamless blending.
    * **Gaussian Blur:** To smooth out edges and create a natural transition between image components.
    * **High-Pass and Low-Pass Filters:** To isolate and manipulate specific frequency components of the images, allowing for the emphasis of different features in the hybrid image.

* **Parameter Adjustment:**

Users will be able to adjust parameters related to the image processing techniques, allowing for fine-tuning of the hybrid image's appearance.

* **Image Output:** The program will generate and display the resulting hybrid image, allowing users to save it in a desired format.

### Technical Requirements

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy and OpenCV

### Requirements

* **Functional Requirements:**

    1. The program must accept two images as input.
    2. The program must implement cross-correlation, convolution, Gaussian blur, high-pass, and low-pass filtering techniques.
    3. The program must generate a hybrid image that visually combines features from both input images.
    4. The program must allow users to adjust parameters related to the image processing techniques.
    5. The program must display and allow saving of the generated hybrid image.

* **Non-Functional Requirements:**

    1. The program must be user-friendly and intuitive.

    2. The program should be efficient and generate hybrid images in a reasonable amount of time.
    3. The program should be well-documented and maintainable.

### Usage

The Hybrid-Images program will be a command-line application. Users will provide the paths to the two input images as arguments.

```
python hybrid_images.py image1.jpg image2.jpg
```

The program will then process the images, generate the hybrid image, and display it on the screen. Users will be prompted to save the generated image.

### Acceptance Criteria

The Hybrid-Images program will be considered successful if it meets the following acceptance criteria:

* **Functionality:** All functional requirements are met and the program generates visually coherent hybrid images.

* **Performance:** The program generates hybrid images within a reasonable timeframe.
* **Usability:** The program is easy to use and understand, with clear instructions and intuitive controls.
* **Documentation:** The program is well-documented, including user instructions and code comments.

* **Maintainability:** The program code is well-structured and easy to modify.
