 It is often used to remove noise and retain large-scale features.

Here is the UML-class diagram:
```plantuml

class Image:
  - data: numpy.ndarray
  - width: int
  - height: int
  + __init__(path: str)
  + apply_filter(filter: Filter): Image
  + blur(sigma: float, kernel_size: int): Image
  + cross_correlate(other: Image): numpy.ndarray
  + convolve(kernel: numpy.ndarray): Image

class Filter:
  <<abstract>>
  + apply(image: Image): Image

class LowPassFilter(Filter):
  - cutoff_frequency: float
  + __init__(cutoff_frequency: float)
  + apply(image: Image): Image

class HighPassFilter(Filter):
  - cutoff_frequency: float
  + __init__(cutoff_frequency: float)
  + apply(image: Image): Image

class HybridImage:
  - image1: Image
  - image2: Image
  - mix_ratio: float
  - filter1: Filter
  - filter2: Filter
  + __init__(image1: Image, image2: Image, mix_ratio: float, filter1: Filter, filter2: Filter)
  + generate(): Image

class GaussianBlur:
  - sigma: float
  - kernel_size: int
  + __init__(sigma: float, kernel_size: int)
  + apply(image: Image): Image

This design effectively encapsulates the required functionality, adhering to object-oriented principles and leveraging established libraries (NumPy and OpenCV) for efficient image processing. The `Image` class provides a foundation for applying filters, blurring, and correlation operations, while `Filter` and its subclasses (`LowPassFilter`, `HighPassFilter`) enable flexible filtering. The `HybridImage` class orchestrates the combination of filtered images according to specified parameters. A clear separation of concerns, accompanied by comprehensive testing and illustrative examples, facilitates maintainability, extensibility, and user understanding. The provided `requirements.txt` and file structure ensure seamless dependency management and organization. This robust design meets the stipulated requirements, producing visually coherent hybrid images that adapt to varying viewing scales or distances.
