Each file and directory in the tree has a specific role:

README.md: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
requirements.txt: Lists all the dependencies of the program.
demo.py: A demonstration script showing the usage of the program.
examples: A directory containing sample images for demonstration purposes.
UML: A directory containing UML diagrams showing the class structure and sequence of operations.
src: A directory containing the source code of the program.
hybrid_image.py: The main Python module implementing the hybrid image creation functionality.
The structure of the program is designed to be modular, with different modules handling different aspects of the image processing and hybrid image creation.
