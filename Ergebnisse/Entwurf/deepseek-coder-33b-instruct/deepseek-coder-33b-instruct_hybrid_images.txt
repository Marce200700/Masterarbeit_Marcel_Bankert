Hybrid Image: An image that is created by combining two images, typically with different frequency content, resulting in an image that changes in appearance at different viewing scales.
Gaussian Blur: A smoothing technique applied to images, characterized by the sigma parameter, which defines the spread of the blur.
High-Pass Filter: An image processing technique that amplifies the high-frequency components of the image, often highlighting edges and fine details.
Low-Pass Filter: An image processing technique that suppresses high-frequency components, resulting in a blurrier image.
Cross-Correlation: A mathematical operation that compares two sets of data and measures the similarity between them.
Convolution: A mathematical operation that involves sliding one function over another and calculating the integral of the product of the two functions for each point.

Please note this is a complex project and the task can be subdivided into several smaller tasks such as creating the hybrid image, creating the low-pass and high-pass filters, implementing the cross-correlation and convolution functions, etc.

In the end, you will have a Python program that combines images into a hybrid image using various image processing techniques.

File descriptions
main.py: This is the entry point of the application. It creates instances of the Image, LowPassFilter, HighPassFilter, GaussianBlurFilter, CrossCorrelation, Convolution, and HybridImage classes and calls the create_hybrid_image() method of the HybridImage class.
image.py: This file contains the Image class. It takes an image path as input and provides methods to return the image as a numpy array and a grayscale version of the image.
low_pass_filter.py: This file contains the LowPassFilter class, which applies a low-pass filter to an image.
high_pass_filter.py: This file contains the HighPassFilter class, which applies a high-pass filter to an image.
gaussian_blur_filter.py: This file contains the GaussianBlurFilter class, which applies a Gaussian blur filter to an image.
cross_correlation.py: This file contains the CrossCorrelation class, which calculates the cross-correlation between two images.
convolution.py: This file contains the Convolution class, which calculates the convolution between two images.
hybrid_image.py: This file contains the HybridImage class. It applies filters to two images, calculates the cross-correlation and convolution, and then combines the two images into a hybrid image.
requirements.txt: This file lists the dependencies of the application. It includes the opencv-python and numpy libraries.

Requirements
opencv-python==4.5.4.60
numpy==1.21.4

Execution
The application can be run by executing the following command in the terminal:

python main.py

Acceptance criteria
The program should successfully create a hybrid image given two source images. The hybrid image should visibly combine features from both images in a coherent manner.
