The structure of the project could be represented by a tree:

```

    │   └── wrapper
    ├── build
    │   ├── classes
    │   │   └── java
    │   │       └── Actor_relationship_game
    │   ├── dists
    │   ├── libs
    │   └── tmp
    │       └── main
    │           └── classes
    │               └── Actor_relationship_game
    ├── build.gradle

                    ├── GameplayInterface.java
                    ├── GraphCreation.java

Here is a short explanation of each file or directory:

- `.gradle`: A directory used by Gradle to store configuration files.
- `build`: A directory where the compiled Java files are stored.
- `gradle`: A directory used by Gradle to store configuration files.
- `gradlew`: A script used to run Gradle tasks on Unix-based systems.
- `gradlew.bat`: A script used to run Gradle tasks on Windows-based systems.
- `src`: A directory that contains all the source code files.
- `build.gradle`: A configuration file used by Gradle to define the project settings and dependencies.
- `Actor.java`, `ActorGraph.java`, `ActorGraphUtil.java`, `GameplayInterface.java`, `GraphCreation.java`, `Movie.java`, and `TMDBApi.java`: Java source files that contain the classes for the Actor Relationship Game.

This is a simple explanation of the file tree structure of the project. In reality, it could be much more complex depending on the size and complexity of the project.

Please note: This is a general guideline and the actual structure of the project may vary based on the specific requirements and structure of your project.
