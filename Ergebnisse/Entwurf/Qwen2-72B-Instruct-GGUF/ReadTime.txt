The `examples/demo.py` script demonstrates how to use the `ReadTime` class to estimate reading time for different formats of content. The script takes the content, format, and WPM rate as input and returns the estimated reading time. The script can be run using the command `python examples/demo.py`. The `ReadTime` class uses the `ContentProcessor` class to process the content and the `ReadingTimeEstimator` class to estimate the reading time. The `ContentProcessor` class processes the content based on the format and returns the processed content. The `ReadingTimeEstimator` class estimates the reading time based on the processed content and the WPM rate. The `ReadTime` class combines the functionality of the `ContentProcessor` and `ReadingTimeEstimator` classes to estimate the reading time for different formats of content. The `tests` directory contains test cases for HTML, markdown, and plain text formats. These test cases validate the functionality of the `ReadTime` class and ensure that it accurately estimates the reading time for different formats of content. The `samples` directory contains sample files for testing and validation. These files are used to test the tool's ability to process different formats of content and accurately estimate reading time. The `requirements.txt` file lists the required dependencies for the project, including the `beautifulsoup4`,
