 (e.g., A-B, B-C; the connection path between A and C is A-B, B-C)
Actor Relationship Game: A Java-based application that allows users to explore connections between popular actors through their movie collaborations, using data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API.
TMDB API Wrapper: A class that handles API calls to TMDB to fetch actor and movie data.
Actor: A class that represents an actor with a unique ID, name, and a set of movie IDs they have appeared in.
Movie: A class that represents a movie with a unique ID, title, and a set of actor IDs involved in the movie.
Graph Creation Module: A class that constructs and populates the ActorGraph using data fetched from the TMDB API.
ActorGraph Utility: A class that manages the serialization and deserialization of the ActorGraph, and writes actor names to actors_list.txt with specified path.
Gameplay Interface: A class that provides user interaction for exploring actor relationships and outputs the results.

The system architecture diagram above shows the high-level components of the Actor Relationship Game project and their interactions. The TMDB API provides the actor and movie data, which is fetched by the TMDBApi class. The ActorGraph class creates the graph data structure, which is then serialized and deserialized by the ActorGraphUtil class. The GameplayInterface class provides the user interface for exploring actor connections.
The note over the System package provides a detailed explanation of the components included in the Actor Relationship Game project, including the TMDB API Wrapper, Actor and Movie classes, Graph Creation Module, ActorGraph Utility, and Gameplay Interface. The note over the TMDB package provides a description of the TMDB API. The note over the ActorGraph package provides a description of the graph data structure. The note over the GraphCreation package provides a description of the GraphCreation class. The note over the ActorGraphUtil package provides a description of the ActorGraphUtil class. The note over the GameplayInterface package provides a description of the GameplayInterface class. The note over the Actor package provides a description of the Actor class. The note over the Movie package provides a description of the Movie class. The note over the TMDBApi package provides a description of the TMDBApi class. The note over the ActorGraphUtil package provides a description of the ActorGraphUtil class.
The system architecture diagram provides a clear representation of the project's components and their interactions, making it easier to understand the project's architecture and functionality. The UML class diagram, sequence diagram, file tree diagram, and build dependencies diagram provide a comprehensive software design for the Actor Relationship Game project, ensuring that all necessary components are included and understood. Together, these elements provide a complete software design for the Actor Relationship Game project.
