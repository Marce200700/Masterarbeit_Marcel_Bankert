File and Directory Descriptions:

`hybrid_image.py`: This file contains the HybridImage class, which is responsible for creating a hybrid image by combining two source images using specified filters and mix ratio.

`image_processor.py`: This file contains the ImageProcessor class, which provides methods for applying various image processing operations such as cross-correlation, convolution, Gaussian blur, low-pass filter, and high-pass filter.

`hybrid_image_creator.py`: This file contains the HybridImageCreator class, which utilizes the ImageProcessor class to create a hybrid image by applying specified filters to the source images and combining them using the specified mix ratio.

`examples`: This directory contains example scripts for using the HybridImageCreator class to create hybrid images.

`demo.py`: This file is an example script that demonstrates how to create a hybrid image using the HybridImageCreator class.

`requirements.txt`: This file lists the required dependencies for the project, including the OpenCV and NumPy libraries. To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` To create a hybrid image using the provided classes and methods, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary classes from the respective files:
```python
from image_processor import ImageProcessor
from hybrid_image_creator import HybridImageCreator
from hybrid_image import HybridImage
```
1. Load the source images and create an instance of the ImageProcessor class:
```python
import cv2

image1 = cv2.imread("path/to/image1.jpg")
image2 = cv2.imread("path/to/image2.jpg")

processor = ImageProcessor()
```
1. Apply the desired image processing operations to the source images using the ImageProcessor class:
```python
processed_image1 = processor.apply_gaussian_blur(image1, sigma=1.0, size=5)
processed_image2 = processor.apply_high_pass_filter(image2)
```
1. Create an instance of the HybridImageCreator class and use it to create a hybrid image:
```python
creator = HybridImageCreator()

hybrid_image = creator.create_hybrid_image(processed_image1, processed_image2, mix_ratio=0.5, filter1="low", filter2="high")
```
1. Save the hybrid image to a file:
```python
cv2.imwrite("path/to/hybrid_image.jpg", hybrid_image.get_image())
```
You can adjust the parameters and filters used in the image processing operations to achieve the desired appearance of the hybrid image. Additionally, you can experiment with different mix ratios to control the relative contribution of each source image to the hybrid image. To run the example script, navigate to the `examples` directory and execute the following command:
```bash
python demo.py
```
This will create a hybrid image using the provided source images and save it to a file. You can modify the script to use your own source images and adjust the parameters to suit your needs. Note that the example script assumes that the source images are located in the `examples` directory and are named `image1.jpg` and `image2.jpg`. If your source images have different names or are located in a different directory, you will need to update the file paths in the script accordingly. Additionally, the example script uses default parameters for the image processing operations and hybrid image creation. You can modify these parameters to achieve different results. For example, you can adjust the sigma value and kernel size used in the Gaussian blur operation to control the amount of blurring applied to the image. Similarly, you can adjust the mix ratio used in the hybrid image creation to control the relative contribution of each source image to the hybrid image. Finally, you can experiment with different filter types (low-pass, high-pass) to achieve different visual effects in the hybrid image. For example, using a low-pass filter on one source image and a high-pass filter on the other can result in a hybrid image that appears to change in appearance when viewed from different distances or scales. Overall, the provided classes and methods provide a flexible framework for creating hybrid images using various image processing techniques. By adjusting the parameters and filters used in the image processing operations and hybrid image creation, you can achieve a wide range of visual effects and create hybrid images that exhibit properties of both source images at different viewing scales or distances. Thank you for the detailed explanation. It's clear that the provided classes and methods offer a flexible framework for creating hybrid images using various image processing techniques. By adjusting the parameters and filters used in the image processing operations and hybrid image creation, one can achieve a wide range of visual effects and create hybrid images that exhibit properties of both source images at different viewing scales or distances. The example script provided in the `examples` directory can be used as a starting point for experimenting with different source images and parameters. However, it's important to note that the quality of the hybrid image will depend on the quality of the source images and the parameters used in the image processing operations and hybrid image creation. Therefore, it's recommended to use high-quality source images and carefully adjust the parameters to achieve the desired visual effects. Additionally, it's important to consider the limitations of the image processing techniques used in the hybrid image creation. For example, the Gaussian blur operation can result in a loss of detail in the source images, which may affect the quality of the hybrid image. Similarly, the low-pass and high-pass filters used in the hybrid image creation may not always produce the desired visual effects, depending on the properties of the source images. Therefore, it's important to experiment with different parameters and filters to achieve the best results. Overall, the provided classes and methods offer a powerful tool for creating hybrid images using various image processing techniques. By carefully adjusting the parameters and filters used in the image processing operations and hybrid image creation, one can achieve a wide range of visual effects and create hybrid images that exhibit properties of both source images at different viewing scales or distances. You're welcome! I'm glad that the explanation was helpful.
