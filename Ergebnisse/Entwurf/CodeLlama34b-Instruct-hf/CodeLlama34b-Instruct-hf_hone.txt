Context Manager is a Python construct that allows you to define a block of code that can be used to manage resources. It ensures that the resources are properly handled, even if an exception occurs.

CLI (Command-Line Interface) is a text-based interface for interacting with a computer program. It allows users to interact with the program by typing commands and receiving output in a text format.

UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standardized modeling language used to visualize design and implementation of software systems. It is used to create diagrams that represent the different aspects of a system, such as its structure, behavior, and interactions.
