 Cross-Correlation: A measure of similarity between two images, often used for image matching and registration.
Convolution: A mathematical operation that combines two functions (in this case, images) by sliding one over the other, element-wise multiplying, and summing the results.

Here is the UML-class diagram:
```plantuml
@startuml
class ImageProcessor {
  - image: Image
  - sigma: float
  - kernel_size: int
  - low_pass_filter: Filter
  - high_pass_filter: Filter

  + __init__(image: Image, sigma: float, kernel_size: int)
  + apply_gaussian_blur(): Image
  + apply_low_pass_filter(): Image
  + apply_high_pass_filter(): Image
  + cross_correlation(other_image: Image): float
  + convolution(other_image: Image): Image
}

class Filter {
  - type: str
  - kernel: np.ndarray

  + __init__(type: str, kernel: np.ndarray)
  + apply(image: Image): Image
}

class Image {
  - data: np.ndarray

  + __init__(data: np.ndarray)
  + get_data(): np.ndarray
}

class HybridImageCreator {
  - image1: Image
  - image2: Image
  - mix_ratio: float
  - filter_type1: str
  - filter_type2: str

  + __init__(image1: Image, image2: Image, mix_ratio: float, filter_type1: str, filter_type2: str)
  + create_hybrid_image(): Image
}

Note that this is just one possible implementation, and you may choose to organize your code differently. Additionally, you will need to implement the actual logic for the image processing operations and hybrid image creation, which is not included in this design.
