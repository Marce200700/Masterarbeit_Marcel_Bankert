 (e.g., A-B, B-C; the connection path between A and C is A-B-C)
Serialization: The process of converting an object's state to a byte stream in Java.
Deserialization: The process of reconstructing an object from a byte stream in Java.

File Description
TMDBApi.java: Handles API calls to TMDB to fetch actor and movie data.
Actor.java: Represents an actor with a unique ID, name, and a set of movie IDs they have appeared in.
Movie.java: Represents a movie with a unique ID, title, and a set of actor IDs involved in the movie.
GraphCreation.java: Constructs and populates the ActorGraph using data fetched from the TMDB API.
ActorGraph.java: A graph data structure that represents actors as nodes and their movie collaborations as edges.
ActorGraphUtil.java: Manages the serialization and deserialization of the ActorGraph, and writes actor names to actors_list.txt.
GameplayInterface.java: Provides user interaction for exploring actor relationships and outputs the results.
build.gradle: Specifies dependencies and configurations for the project.
TMDBApiTest.java: Tests the TMDB API wrapper.
ActorTest.java: Tests the Actor class.
MovieTest.java: Tests the Movie class.
GraphCreationTest.java: Tests the Graph Creation module.
ActorGraphTest.java: Tests the ActorGraph class.
ActorGraphUtilTest.java: Tests the ActorGraph Utility.
GameplayInterfaceTest.java: Tests the Gameplay Interface.
ActorRelationshipGameAcceptanceTest.java: Tests the overall functionality of the Actor Relationship Game.
actorGraph.ser: Serialized ActorGraph data.
actors_list.txt: List of actor names.
actor_connection_results.txt: Output file for actor connections.
