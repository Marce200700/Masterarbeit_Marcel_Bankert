> This document details the requirements for a web frontend application focused on user login and registration. The application aims to provide a seamless and secure experience for users to create accounts and access their profiles. Built using Vue 2.x and Babel 6.x in JavaScript, the application will offer a modern, responsive design suitable for various devices and browsers.
I want you to implement a necessary component inside the LoginPage.vue file. I need you to add a new password input field. Furthermore you should not accept inputs under the length of 6 characters.
Here is the current LoginPage.vue file:
 <template>
    <div>
        <h2>Login</h2>
        <form @submit.prevent="handleSubmit">
             <div class="form-group">

                <input type="text" v-model="username" name="username" class="form-control" :class="{ 'is-invalid': submitted && !username }" />
                <div v-show="submitted && !username" class="invalid-feedback">Username is required</div>
            </div>
            <div class="form-group">
                <button class="btn btn-primary" :disabled="status.loggingIn">Login</button>

You should create a new method called `checkPassword`.

This method should be called inside of the `handleSubmit` method.


>
It should check if the `password` property is less than 6 characters.

If it is, it should call `alert` with the message "Password must be at least 6 characters".

Otherwise, it should call `this.$store.dispatch` with the `login` action and the `username` and `password` properties.

Your implementation of `checkPassword` will look like this:

        ...mapState('account', ['status'])
    },
    created () {
    },
    methods: {
        checkPassword () {
            if (this.password.length < 6) {
                alert('Password must be at least 6 characters')
                return
            }

            this.$store.dispatch('login', {
                username: this.username,
                password: this.password
