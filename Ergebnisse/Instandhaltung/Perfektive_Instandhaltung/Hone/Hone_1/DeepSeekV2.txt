> The Hone project is designed to facilitate the conversion of CSV files into nested JSON formats. It aims to provide a robust and flexible solution for transforming flat CSV data structures into hierarchical JSON objects that are more suitable for various applications and data needs.
I would now like to add a new functionality. I need to have a function which parses a csv file and returns the first row and therefore the columns of the input-csv.
To do so, I need to know which file needs to be changed to implement this new functionality. Here is the filetree:
```bash
├── examples
│   ├── demo.py
│   ├── demo.sh
│   ├── example_a.csv
│   ├── example_a.json
│   ├── example_b.csv
│   ├── example_b.json
│   ├── example_c.csv
│   └── example_c.json
├── hone
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── hone.py
│   ├── __main__.py
│   ├── utils
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── csv_utils.py
│   │   ├── json_utils.py
│   │   └── test_utils.py
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
``` To add a new functionality that parses a CSV file and returns the first row and therefore the columns of the input CSV, you need to modify the `csv_utils.py` file. This file is located in the `utils` directory within the `hone` project.

Here's a step-by-step guide to implement this functionality:

1. **Navigate to the `csv_utils.py` file**: Open the `csv_utils.py` file located in the `utils` directory of the `hone` project.

2. **Add the new function**: Add a new function that reads the first row of the CSV file and returns it.

Here's an example of how you can implement this:

```python
# hone/utils/csv_utils.py

import csv

def get_csv_columns(csv_file_path):
    """
    Reads the first row of the CSV file and returns it as a list of column names.

    Args:
        csv_file_path (str): The path to the CSV file
>
.

    Returns:
        list: The first row of the CSV file as a list of column names.
    """
    with open(csv_file_path, mode='r', newline='') as csvfile:
        csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile)
        first_row = next(csvreader)
        return first_row

```

3. **Update the `__init__.py` file**: Ensure that the `__init__.py` file in the `utils` directory is properly configured to allow importing from `csv_utils.py`.

```python
# hone/utils/__init__.py

from .csv_utils import get_csv_columns
```

4. **Use the new function**: Now you can use the `get_csv_columns` function in your project. For example, you can call it from `demo.py` to test the functionality.

```python
# examples/demo.py

from hone.utils.csv_utils import get_csv_columns

# Example usage
csv_file_path = 'examples/example_a.csv'
columns = get_csv_columns(csv_file_path)
print(columns)
```

5. **Run the script**: Execute the script to verify that the function works as expected.

```bash
./examples/demo.sh
```

By following these steps, you will have added a new functionality to your project that reads the first row of a CSV file and returns the column names.
