> The Hone project is designed to facilitate the conversion of CSV files into nested JSON formats. It aims to provide a robust and flexible solution for transforming flat CSV data structures into hierarchical JSON objects that are more suitable for various applications and data needs.
I would now like to add a new functionality. I need to have a function which parses a csv file and returns the first row and therefore the columns of the input-csv.
To do so, I need to know which file needs to be changed to implement this new functionality. Here is the filetree:
```bash
├── examples
│   ├── demo.py
│   ├── demo.sh
│   ├── example_a.csv
│   ├── example_a.json
│   ├── example_b.csv
│   ├── example_b.json
│   ├── example_c.csv
│   └── example_c.json
├── hone
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── hone.py
│   ├── __main__.py
│   ├── utils
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── csv_utils.py
│   │   ├── json_utils.py
│   │   └── test_utils.py
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```Based on your description, I can tell that the `csv_utils.py` file needs to be modified to include the new functionality. This functionality is related to parsing a CSV file and returning the first row, which would represent the columns of the CSV file.

To proceed with adding the new functionality, I would need the `csv_utils.py` file. Please upload it.

```python
import csv

# Function to parse a CSV file and return the first row (columns)
def get_csv_columns(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        csv_reader = csv.reader(file)
        columns = next(csv_reader)
    return columns

# Test the function with an example CSV file
columns = get_csv_columns('example_a.csv')
print(columns)
```

To accomplish this task, we'll need to write a Python function that reads a CSV file and returns the first row, which represents the columns of the CSV file. We'll use Python's built-in 'csv' module to parse the CSV file and retrieve the first row. Let's proceed with this task.

Unfortunately, I am unable to directly interact with or access your local files, including 'example_a.csv'. To proceed, please upload the 'csv_utils.py' file and the CSV file you'd like to parse.

        csv_reader = csv.reader(file)
        columns = next(csv_reader)
    return columns

# Test the function with an example CSV file
columns = get_csv_columns('example_a.csv')
print(columns)
```
