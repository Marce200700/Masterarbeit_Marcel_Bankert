> The Hone project is designed to facilitate the conversion of CSV files into nested JSON formats. It aims to provide a robust and flexible solution for transforming flat CSV data structures into hierarchical JSON objects that are more suitable for various applications and data needs.
I would now like to add a new functionality. I need to have a function which parses a csv file and returns the first row and therefore the columns of the input-csv.
To do so, I need to know which file needs to be changed to implement this new functionality. Here is the filetree:
```bash
├── examples
│   ├── demo.py
│   ├── demo.sh
│   ├── example_a.csv
│   ├── example_a.json
│   ├── example_b.csv
│   ├── example_b.json
│   ├── example_c.csv
│   └── example_c.json
├── hone
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── hone.py
│   ├── __main__.py
│   ├── utils
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── csv_utils.py
│   │   ├── json_utils.py
│   │   └── test_utils.py
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```Based on your description, it seems that you should modify the `csv_utils.py` file to include a new function that parses a CSV file and returns the first row, which will give you the column names.

Here's a basic implementation of such a function:

```python
import csv

def get_column_names(csv_file_path):
    with open(csv_file_path, 'r') as file:
        csv_reader = csv.reader(file)
        first_row = next(csv_reader)
    return first_row
```

You can then call this function in your `demo.py` file or wherever you need the column names.
