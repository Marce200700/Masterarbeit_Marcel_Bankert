> The Hone project is designed to facilitate the conversion of CSV files into nested JSON formats. It aims to provide a robust and flexible solution for transforming flat CSV data structures into hierarchical JSON objects that are more suitable for various applications and data needs.
I would now like to add a new functionality. I need to have a function which parses a csv file and returns the first row and therefore the columns of the input-csv.
To do so, I need to know which file needs to be changed to implement this new functionality. Here is the filetree:
```bash
├── examples
│   ├── demo.py
│   ├── demo.sh
│   ├── example_a.csv
│   ├── example_a.json
│   ├── example_b.csv
│   ├── example_b.json
│   ├── example_c.csv
│   └── example_c.json
├── hone
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── hone.py
│   ├── __main__.py
│   ├── utils
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── csv_utils.py
│   │   ├── json_utils.py
│   │   └── test_utils.py
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```To implement the new functionality, I would recommend modifying the `csv_utils.py` file. This file seems to be dedicated to handling CSV-related operations, and adding a function to parse the first row of a CSV file would fit nicely within this module.

You can add a new function, for example, `get_csv_columns`, that takes a CSV file path as input, reads the first row, and returns the column names as a list.

Here's a possible implementation:
```python
# hone/utils/csv_utils.py

import csv

def get_csv_columns(csv_file_path):
    with open(csv_file_path, 'r') as csvfile:
        reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
        columns = next(reader)
    return columns
```
This function uses the `csv` module to read the first row of the CSV file and returns the column names as a list.

By adding this function to `csv_utils.py`, you can keep related functionality organized and easily import it in other parts of the project when needed.

Does this sound like a good approach to you?

I can add the function in the `csv_utils.py` file. Here is the modified file with the new function:

```python
# hone

> /utils/csv_utils.py

import csv

def get_csv_columns(csv_file_path):
    """
    Returns the first row of a CSV file, which typically contains the column names.

    Args:
        csv_file_path (str): Path to the CSV file.

    Returns:
        list: A list of column names.
    """
    with open(csv_file_path, 'r') as csvfile:
        reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
        columns = next(reader)
    return columns
```

You can use this function in your code like this:

```python
# Example usage:
from hone.utils import csv_utils

csv_file_path = 'path/to/your/csv/file.csv'
column_names = csv_utils.get_csv_columns(csv_file_path)
print(column_names)
```

This code opens the specified CSV file, reads the first row, and returns it as a list of column names.
