> The Hone project is designed to facilitate the conversion of CSV files into nested JSON formats. It aims to provide a robust and flexible solution for transforming flat CSV data structures into hierarchical JSON objects that are more suitable for various applications and data needs.
I would now like to add a new functionality. I need to have a function which parses a csv file and just returns the data of the input-csv without the first row.
To do so, I need to know which file needs to be changed to implement this new functionality. Here is the filetree:
```bash
├── examples
│   ├── demo.py
│   ├── demo.sh
│   ├── example_a.csv
│   ├── example_a.json
│   ├── example_b.csv
│   ├── example_b.json
│   ├── example_c.csv
│   └── example_c.json

│   │   ├── csv_utils.py
│   │   ├── json_utils.py
│   │   └── test_utils.py
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```Based on the file tree you provided, I would recommend modifying the `csv_utils.py` file to implement the new functionality. This file is likely responsible for handling CSV-related operations, and adding a function to parse a CSV file and return the data without the first row would fit well within this module.

Specifically, you could add a new function to `csv_utils.py` that reads a CSV file and returns the data starting from the second row. This function could be named something like `read_csv_data_without_header` or `parse_csv_without_first_row`.

Here's an example of what the new function might look like:
```python
import csv

def read_csv_data_without_header(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        next(reader)  # skip the first row
        data = list(reader)
        return data
```
This function uses the `csv` module to read the CSV file and skips the first row using the `next` function. It then returns the remaining data as a list of lists.

By adding this function to `csv_utils.py`, you can keep the new functionality organized and separate from the existing code, making it easier to

 maintain and reuse in the future.
