> The Hone project is designed to facilitate the conversion of CSV files into nested JSON formats. It aims to provide a robust and flexible solution for transforming flat CSV data structures into hierarchical JSON objects that are more suitable for various applications and data needs.
I would now like to add a new functionality. I need to have a function which parses a csv file and just returns the data of the input-csv without the first row.
To do so, I need to know which file needs to be changed to implement this new functionality. Here is the filetree:
```bash
├── examples
│   ├── demo.py
│   ├── demo.sh
│   ├── example_a.csv
│   ├── example_a.json
│   ├── example_b.csv
│   ├── example_b.json
│   ├── example_c.csv
│   └── example_c.json
├── hone
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── hone.py
│   ├── __main__.py
│   ├── utils
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── csv_utils.py
│   │   ├── json_utils.py
│   │   └── test_utils.py
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
``` To add a new functionality that parses a CSV file and returns the data without the first row, you need to modify the `csv_utils.py` file in the `utils` directory of the `hone` module. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Navigate to the `utils` directory:**
   ```bash
   cd hone/utils
   ```

2. **Open the `csv_utils.py` file for editing:**
   ```bash
   nano csv_utils.py
   ```

3. **Add the new function to `csv_utils.py`:**

   Here's an example of how you can add a function called `parse_csv_without_header` that reads a CSV file and returns the data without the first row:

   ```python
   import csv
   import json

   def parse_csv_without_header(file_path):
       """
       Parses a CSV file and returns the data without the first row.

       Args:
           file_path (str): The path
>
 to the CSV file.

       Returns:
           list: A list of dictionaries representing the rows in the CSV file, excluding the first row.
       """
       data = []
       with open(file_path, mode='r', newline='') as csvfile:
           csvreader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
           for row in csvreader:
               data.append(row)
       return data
   ```

4. **Save the changes and exit the editor (if using `nano`, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to confirm, and `Enter` to save).**

5. **Test the new function using the provided examples:**

   You can create a script in the `examples` directory to test this new functionality. For example, you can create a script named `demo.py` in the `examples` directory to test the `parse_csv_without_header` function:

   ```python
   from hone.utils import csv_utils

   csv_file_path = 'examples/example_a.csv'
   data = csv_utils.parse_csv_without_header(csv_file_path)
   print(json.dumps(data, indent=4))
   ```

   Then, you can run this script using:

   ```bash
   python examples/demo.py
   ```

This will output the JSON representation of the CSV data without the first row, which you can verify against the expected JSON files in the `examples` directory.

By following these steps, you will have added the new functionality to parse a CSV file and return the data without the first row.
