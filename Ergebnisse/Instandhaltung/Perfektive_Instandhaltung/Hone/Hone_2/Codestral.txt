> The Hone project is designed to facilitate the conversion of CSV files into nested JSON formats. It aims to provide a robust and flexible solution for transforming flat CSV data structures into hierarchical JSON objects that are more suitable for various applications and data needs.
I would now like to add a new functionality. I need to have a function which parses a csv file and just returns the data of the input-csv without the first row.
To do so, I need to know which file needs to be changed to implement this new functionality. Here is the filetree:
```bash
├── examples
│   ├── demo.py
│   ├── demo.sh
│   ├── example_a.csv
│   ├── example_a.json
│   ├── example_b.csv
│   ├── example_b.json
│   ├── example_c.csv
│   └── example_c.json
├── hone
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── hone.py
│   ├── __main__.py
│   ├── utils
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── csv_utils.py
│   │   ├── json_utils.py
│   │   └── test_utils.py
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```Based on your request, it seems like you need to modify the 'csv_utils.py' file inside the 'utils' folder. This file is likely responsible for handling CSV operations in the Hone project.

Here is the Python code snippet that you can use to parse a CSV file and return the data without the first row:

```python
import csv

def parse_csv_without_header(file_path):
    data = []
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        csv_reader = csv.reader(file)
        next(csv_reader)  # Skip the header row
        for row in csv_reader:
            data.append(row)
    return data
```

You can replace the existing function for par

sing CSV files in the 'csv_utils.py' file with this new function.
