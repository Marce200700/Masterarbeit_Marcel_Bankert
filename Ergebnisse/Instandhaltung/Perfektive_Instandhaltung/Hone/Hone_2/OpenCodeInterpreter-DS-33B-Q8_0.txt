> The Hone project is designed to facilitate the conversion of CSV files into nested JSON formats. It aims to provide a robust and flexible solution for transforming flat CSV data structures into hierarchical JSON objects that are more suitable for various applications and data needs.
I would now like to add a new functionality. I need to have a function which parses a csv file and just returns the data of the input-csv without the first row.
To do so, I need to know which file needs to be changed to implement this new functionality. Here is the filetree:
```bash
├── examples
│   ├── demo.py
│   ├── demo.sh
│   ├── example_a.csv
│   ├── example_a.json
│   ├── example_b.csv
│   ├── example_b.json
│   ├── example_c.csv
│   └── example_c.json

│   │   ├── csv_utils.py
│   │   ├── json_utils.py
│   │   └── test_utils.py
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```The file that needs to be changed to implement this new functionality is `hone/hone.py`.

The new function in `hone/hone.py` could be something like this:

```python
def parse_csv_data(csv_file_path: str) -> list[dict[str, str]]:
    with open(csv_file_path, 'r') as csv_file:
        csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file)
        data = [row for row in csv_reader]
    return data[1:]  # Return all rows except the first one.
```

In this function, we use the `csv.DictReader` function to read the CSV file and store it as a list of dictionaries. We then return all the rows except the first one.

This function can be called with the path to the CSV file as the argument to get the data without the first row.

You can run this function with your desired CSV file in the `examples/demo.py` file. Let's do this.
```python
import csv

def parse_csv_data(csv_file_path: str) -> list[dict[str, str]]:
    with open(csv_file_path, 'r') as csv_file:
        csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file)
        data = [row for row in csv_reader]
    return data[1:]  # Return all rows except the first one.

csv_file_path = 'path_to_your_csv_file'
data = parse_csv_data(csv_file_path)
print(data)
