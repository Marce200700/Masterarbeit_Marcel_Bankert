> The Hone project is designed to facilitate the conversion of CSV files into nested JSON formats. It aims to provide a robust and flexible solution for transforming flat CSV data structures into hierarchical JSON objects that are more suitable for various applications and data needs.
I would now like to add a new functionality. I need to have a function which writes a given JSON to a given file, or standard output if filepath is "-".
To do so, I need to know which file needs to be changed to implement this new functionality. Here is the filetree:
```bash
├── examples
│   ├── demo.py
│   ├── demo.sh
│   ├── example_a.csv
│   ├── example_a.json
│   ├── example_b.csv
│   ├── example_b.json
│   ├── example_c.csv
│   └── example_c.json
├── hone
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── hone.py
│   ├── __main__.py
│   ├── utils
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── csv_utils.py
│   │   ├── json_utils.py
│   │   └── test_utils.py
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```Based on your description and the file tree you provided, it seems that the `json_utils.py` file located in the `hone/utils` directory is the most likely candidate for implementing the new functionality of writing a given JSON to a given file or standard output.

Here's a basic outline of how you could modify the `json_utils.py` file to include this functionality:

1. Import the necessary Python modules (like `json` and `sys`).
2. Define a function, let's call it `write_json`, that takes two parameters: `data` (the JSON data to write) and `filepath` (the path to the file to write to, or "-" for standard output).
3. In the `write_json` function, check if `filepath` is "-". If it is, use
>
 `sys.stdout.write(json.dumps(data))` to write the JSON data to standard output.
4. If `filepath` is not "-", use `with open(filepath, 'w') as f:` to open the file, and then use `json.dump(data, f)` to write the JSON data to the file.
5. Make sure to handle any potential errors that might occur during the file writing process.

> Ok please implement the function.
```python
import json
import sys

def write_json(data, filepath):
    if filepath == '-':
        sys.stdout.write(json.dumps(data))
    else:
        try:
            with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
                json.dump(data, f)
        except IOError as e:
            print(f"An error occurred while writing to the file: {e}")
```
This function `write_json` takes two arguments: `data` (which is the JSON data to be written) and `filepath` (which is the path to the file to write to, or "-" to write to standard output). The function first checks if `filepath` is "-". If it is, it writes the JSON data to standard output using `sys.stdout.write(json.dumps(data))`. If `filepath` is not "-", it opens the file in write mode and writes the JSON data to the file using `json.dump(data, f)`. If an error occurs while writing to the file, it catches the `IOError` and prints an error message.
