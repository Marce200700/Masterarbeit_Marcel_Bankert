You are a helpful Python programer.


> The purpose of this project is to develop a Python-based tool that can estimate the reading time for various formats of content. This tool will be able to process HTML and plain text, providing users with an approximate reading time based on a standard or user-defined words-per-minute (WPM) rate.
I want to add a new functionality. The user should be able to use markdown as an input as well. Please tell me which file I need to change to implement this function.
Here is the filetree:

```bash
├── examples
│   ├── demo.py
│   └── demo.sh
├── readtime
│   ├── __about__.py
│   ├── api.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── result.py
│   └── utils.py
```To add markdown support to your reading time estimator tool, you'll likely need to modify the `utils.py` file. This file probably contains utility functions for processing and parsing different input formats, such as HTML and plain text.

To add markdown support, you can import a markdown parsing library (e.g., `markdown` or `mistletoe`) in `utils.py` and create a new function to parse markdown input. This function can convert the markdown text into plain text or HTML, which can then be processed by the existing reading time estimation logic.

Here's a rough outline of the changes you might make:

1. Install a markdown parsing library, e.g., `pip install markdown`
2. In `utils.py`, import the markdown library and create a new function, e.g., `parse_markdown()`, that takes markdown text as input and returns the converted plain text or HTML.
3. Update the existing reading time estimation logic to call the new `parse_markdown()` function when markdown input is detected.

By modifying `utils.py`, you can add markdown support without affecting the other files in your project.

Do you want me to provide you with a sample implementation of the `parse_markdown()` function?

Here's a sample implementation of the `parse_markdown()` function using the `markdown` library:
```python
import markdown

def parse_markdown(markdown_text):
    """
    Convert markdown text to plain text.

    Args:
        markdown_text (str): Markdown text to convert.

    Returns:
        str: Converted plain text.
    """
    html = markdown.markdown(markdown_text)
    # Remove HTML tags to get plain text
    plain_text = ''.join([line.strip() for line in html.splitlines() if not line.strip().startswith('<')])
    return plain_text
```
This implementation uses the `markdown.markdown()` function to convert the markdown text to HTML, and then removes the HTML tags to get the plain text.

You can use this function in your reading time estimation logic to process markdown input. For example:
```python
def estimate_reading_time(text, wpm=200):
    if is_markdown(text):
        text = parse_markdown(text)
    # Existing reading time estimation logic
```
Note that you'll need to implement the `is_markdown()` function to detect whether the input text is in markdown format.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like further assistance!
