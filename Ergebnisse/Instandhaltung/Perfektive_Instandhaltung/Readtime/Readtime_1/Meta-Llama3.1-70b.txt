You are a helpful Python programer.


> The purpose of this project is to develop a Python-based tool that can estimate the reading time for various formats of content. This tool will be able to process plain text and markdown formats, providing users with an approximate reading time based on a standard or user-defined words-per-minute (WPM) rate.
I want to add a new functionality. The user should be able to use HTML as an input as well. Please tell me which file I need to change to implement this function.
Here is the filetree:

```bash
├── examples
│   ├── demo.py
│   └── demo.sh
├── readtime
│   ├── __about__.py
│   ├── api.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── result.py
│   └── utils.py
```Nice project!

To add support for HTML input, I'd recommend modifying the `utils.py` file. This file likely contains utility functions for parsing and processing text, and adding HTML support would fit nicely into this category.

Specifically, you could add a function to `utils.py` that takes an HTML string as input, extracts the text content, and then passes it to the existing reading time estimation logic.

Here's a rough outline of the steps you could take:

1. In `utils.py`, import the `html` module from the `html.parser` package (or use a library like `beautifulsoup4` for more robust HTML parsing).
2. Create a new function, e.g., `extract_text_from_html(html_string)`, which uses the `html` module to extract the text content from the HTML string.
3. Modify the existing reading time estimation functions to accept an additional parameter, e.g., `content_type`, which can be set to `'html'` when the input is HTML.
4. Update the `content_type` parameter to call the `extract_text_from_html` function when the input is HTML, and then pass the extracted text to the existing reading time estimation logic.

By modifying `utils.py`, you'll be able to reuse the existing reading time estimation logic while adding support for HTML input.

Let me know if you'd like more specific guidance or code snippets to help with the implementation!

> OK please implement the necessary code for this function.
Here's an updated implementation for the `utils.py` file:

```python
import re
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# ... (existing code)

def extract_text_from_html(html_string):
    """
    Extract text content from HTML string.

    Args:
        html_string (str): HTML string to extract text from.

    Returns:
        str: Extracted text content.
    """
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_string, 'html.parser')
    return soup.get_text()

def calculate_reading_time(text, wpm=200, content_type='plain'):
    """
    Calculate reading time based on text and words-per-minute (WPM) rate.

    Args:
        text (str): Text to calculate reading time for.
        wpm (int): Words-per-minute rate (default: 200).
        content_type (str): Type of content (plain, markdown, or html).

    Returns:
        float: Estimated reading time in minutes.
    """
    if content_type == 'html':
        text = extract_text_from_html(text)

    # Remove markdown formatting if present
    if content_type == 'markdown':
        text = re.sub(r'\[.*?\]\(.*?\)', '', text)  # Remove links
        text = re.sub(r'#![^\s]+', '', text)  # Remove headings
        text = re.sub(r'\*\*|__', '', text)  # Remove bold and italic formatting

    # Calculate reading time
    words = text.split()
    reading_time = len(words) / wpm
    return reading_time
```

In this updated implementation:

1. We've added the `extract_text_from_html` function to extract text content from HTML strings using BeautifulSoup.
2. We've updated the `calculate_reading_time` function to accept an additional `content_type` parameter, which can be set to `'html'`, `'markdown'`, or `'plain'`.
3. When `content_type` is `'html'`, we call the `extract_text_from_html` function to extract the text content before calculating the reading time.
4. We've also added some basic markdown formatting removal to the `calculate_reading_time` function when `content_type` is `'markdown'`.

Note that this implementation assumes that the HTML input is well-formed and doesn't contain any complex markup that would interfere with the text extraction. You may want to add additional error handling or sanitization depending on your specific use case.
