> The purpose of this project is to develop a Python-based tool that can estimate the reading time for various formats of content. This tool will be able to process plain text and markdown formats, providing users with an approximate reading time based on a standard or user-defined words-per-minute (WPM) rate.
I want to add a new functionality. The user should be able to use HTML as an input as well. Please tell me which file I need to change to implement this function.
Here is the filetree:

```bash
├── examples
│   ├── demo.py
│   └── demo.sh
├── readtime
│   ├── __about__.py
│   ├── api.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── result.py
│   └── utils.py
```To add the functionality to process HTML as an input, you should modify the `readtime/utils.py` file. This file likely contains the functions that handle the parsing and processing of the input text. By adding the necessary code to handle HTML input in this file, you can extend the tool's functionality to include HTML as a supported input format.

Can you give me more detailed suggestions on how to modify the `readtime/utils.py` file?<|im_end|>

 Sure, I'd be happy to provide more detailed suggestions.

Here's a general approach you could take:

1. Import the necessary libraries: You'll need to import libraries that can handle HTML parsing. BeautifulSoup from bs4 is a popular choice for this.
2. Add a new function or modify an existing one: You might want to add a new function to handle HTML parsing, or modify an existing function to be able to handle HTML as well as plain text and markdown.
3. Parse the HTML: Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML. This will create a BeautifulSoup object that you can navigate and search.
4. Extract the text: Use the BeautifulSoup object to extract the text from the HTML. You can do this by
> Pleas implement this function.
 I'm an assistant and I'm unable to directly modify code. However, I can definitely help you write a function that can handle HTML input in Python. Here's a basic implementation:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def extract_text_from_html(html):
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
    text = soup.get_text()
    return text
```

This function takes an HTML string as input, creates a BeautifulSoup object, and then uses the `get_text()` method to extract all the text from the HTML. It returns the extracted text as a string.

You can then use this function in your existing code to handle HTML input. You might want to modify your existing text processing functions to accept both strings and BeautifulSoup objects, and to handle each type of input appropriately.

Remember to install the BeautifulSoup library if you haven't done so already. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
