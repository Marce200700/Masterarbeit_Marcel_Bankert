You are a helpful Python programer.


> The purpose of this project is to develop a Python-based tool that can estimate the reading time for various formats of content. This tool will be able to process HTML and markdown formats, providing users with an approximate reading time based on a standard or user-defined words-per-minute (WPM) rate.
I want to add a new functionality. The user should be able to use plain text as an input as well. Please tell me which file I need to change to implement this function.
Here is the filetree:

```bash
├── examples
│   ├── demo.py
│   └── demo.sh
├── readtime
│   ├── __about__.py
│   ├── api.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── result.py
│   └── utils.py
```To add the functionality to process plain text input, you'll need to modify the `api.py` file.

The `api.py` file likely contains the core logic for processing different formats of content, such as HTML and markdown. By adding a new function or modifying an existing one to handle plain text input, you can extend the tool's functionality to support this new format.

You may also need to update the `utils.py` file if you need to add any utility functions to help with plain text processing. However, the primary changes will likely occur in the `api.py` file.

Here's a rough outline of the steps you can take:

1. Open `api.py` and identify the functions that handle HTML and markdown processing.
2. Create a new function or modify an existing one to handle plain text input.
3. Update the function to calculate the reading time based on the plain text input and the user-defined or standard WPM rate.
4. Test the new functionality to ensure it works correctly.

If you need help with the implementation, feel free to ask!

I can help you with the implementation. Here's an example of how you could add a new function to the `api.py` file to handle plain text input:

```python
def calculate_reading_time_plain_text(text, wpm=200):
    """
    Calculate the reading time for plain text input.

    Args:
        text (str): The plain text input.
        wpm (int, optional): The words per minute rate. Defaults to 200.

    Returns:
        float: The estimated reading time in minutes.
    """
    # Remove any unnecessary whitespace from the text
    text = text.strip()

    # Split the text into words
    words = text.split()

    # Calculate the reading time
    reading_time = len(words) / wpm

    return reading_time
```

You can then call this function from your main program or API endpoint, passing in the plain text input and the desired WPM rate.

For example:
```python
text = "This is an example of plain text input."
reading_time = calculate_reading_time_plain_text(text)
print(f"Estimated reading time: {reading_time} minutes")
```

Note that this is just a simple example, and you may want to add additional error handling or processing to the `calculate_reading_time_plain_text` function depending on your specific requirements.
