> The purpose of this project is to develop a Python-based tool that can estimate the reading time for various formats of content. This tool will be able to process HTML and markdown formats, providing users with an approximate reading time based on a standard or user-defined words-per-minute (WPM) rate.
I want to add a new functionality. The user should be able to use plain text as an input as well. Please tell me which file I need to change to implement this function.
Here is the filetree:

```bash
├── examples
│   ├── demo.py
│   └── demo.sh
├── readtime
│   ├── __about__.py
│   ├── api.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── result.py
│   └── utils.py
```To implement the functionality of processing plain text as input, you need to modify the `utils.py` file. This file likely contains functions for processing HTML and markdown formats. You can add a new function to handle plain text input in this file. This new function should count the number of words in the text and return that count.

Here's a simplified example of how you might add this functionality:

```python
def count_words_in_text(text):
    return len(text.split())
```

You can then call this function from the `api.py` file when the user provides plain text as input. The `api.py` file likely contains the main function that handles user input and calls the appropriate processing functions. You can modify this function to handle plain text input and call the `count_words_in_text` function when necessary.

The `count_words_in_text` function returns the number of words in the input text. It splits the input text into a list of words using the `split()` function (which splits a string into a list where each word is a list item), and then returns the length of this list.

You can then call this function from the `api.py` file when the user provides plain text as input. The `api.py` file likely contains the main function that handles user input and calls the appropriate processing functions. You can modify this function to handle plain text input and call the `count_words_in_text` function when necessary.

The modified `api.py` function might look something like this:

```python
def get_reading_time(content, wpm=200):
    if is_html(content):
        word_count = count_words_in_html(content)
    elif is_markdown(content):
        word_count = count_words_in_markdown(content)
    else:
        word_count = count_words_in_text(content)

    return word_count / wpm
```

This function first checks if the input content is HTML or markdown, and calls the appropriate function to count the words. If the input is not HTML or markdown, it assumes that it is plain text and calls the `count_words_in_text` function. It then calculates and returns the reading time based on the word count and the user-defined words-per-minute rate.
