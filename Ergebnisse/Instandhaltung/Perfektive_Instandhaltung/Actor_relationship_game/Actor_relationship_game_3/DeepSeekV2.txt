> The Actor Relationship Game is a Java-based application that allows users to explore connections between popular actors through their movie collaborations, using data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API. It constructs an actor graph and identifies the shortest path of relationships between any two actors.
I would like to change the code. I want you to add proper exception handling inside the 'findConnections' function for the case that an IOException occurs.
Here is the current implementation of this function:
\
public void findConnections(List<String[]> actorPairs, String outputFilePath) {
        PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(outputFilePath))
            for (String[] pair : actorPairs) {
                if (pair.length != 2) {
                    System.out.println("Invalid actor pair. Skipping.");
                    continue;
                }

                String actor1Name = pair[0];
                String actor2Name = pair[1];

                // Assuming getActorIdByName is a method in ActorGraph that returns the actor's ID given a name
                String actor1Id = actorGraph.getActorIdByName(actor1Name);
                String actor2Id = actorGraph.getActorIdByName(actor2Name);

                if (actor1Id == null || actor2Id == null) {
                    writer.println("One or both actors not found in the graph.");
                    continue;
                }

                List<Map.Entry<String, String>> connectionPath = actorGraph.findConnectionWithPath(actor1Id, actor2Id);

                if (connectionPath.isEmpty()) {
                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println("No connection found between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ".");
                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println();
                } else {
                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println("Connection Number between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ":" + (connectionPath.size() - 1));
                    writer.println("Connection path between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ":");
                    for (int i = 0; i < connectionPath.size(); i++) {
                        Map.Entry<String, String> step = connectionPath.get(i);
                        writer.println((i + 1) + ". " + step.getKey() + ": " + step.getValue());
                    }
                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println();
                }
            }
    }

 To add proper exception handling inside the `findConnections` function for the case that an `IOException` occurs, you can wrap the critical operations within a `try-catch` block. This will allow you to handle the exception appropriately, such as by logging the error or providing user feedback. Here's how you can modify your code:

```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

public void findConnections(List<String[]> actorPairs, String outputFilePath) {
    PrintWriter writer = null;
    try {
        writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(outputFilePath));
        for (String[] pair : actorPairs) {
            if (pair.length != 2) {
                System.out.println("Invalid actor pair. Skipping.");
                continue;
            }

            String actor1Name = pair[0];
            String actor2Name = pair[1];

            // Assuming getActorIdByName is a method in ActorGraph that returns the actor's ID given a name
            String actor1Id = actorGraph.getActorIdByName(actor1Name);
            String actor2Id = actorGraph.getActorIdByName(actor2Name);

            if (actor1Id == null || actor2Id == null) {
                writer.println("One or both actors not found in the graph.");
                continue;
            }

            List<Map.Entry<String, String>> connectionPath = actorGraph.findConnectionWithPath(actor1Id, actor2Id);

            if (connectionPath.isEmpty()) {
                writer.println("===================================================");
                writer.println("No connection found between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ".");
                writer.println("===================================================");
                writer.println();
            } else {
                writer.println("===================================================");
                writer.println("Connection Number between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ":" + (connectionPath.size() - 1));
                writer.println("Connection path between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ":");
                for (int i
> continue
 = 0; i < connectionPath.size(); i++) {
                    Map.Entry<String, String> step = connectionPath.get(i);
                    writer.println((i + 1) + ". " + step.getKey() + ": " + step.getValue());
                }
                writer.println("===================================================");
                writer.println();
            }
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        System.err.println("An I/O error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
    } finally {
        if (writer != null) {
            writer.close();
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Try-Catch Block**: The `try` block contains the code that might throw an `IOException`, such as writing to a file. If an `IOException` occurs, the `catch` block will handle it by printing an error message to the standard error stream.

2. **Resource Management**: The `finally` block ensures that the `PrintWriter` is closed even if an exception occurs. This is important to release system resources.

3. **Error Handling**: By catching `IOException` and handling it appropriately (printing an error message), you improve the robustness of your application. This way, if something goes wrong with file operations, the application won't terminate unexpectedly.

This approach ensures that your application can handle I/O errors gracefully, making it more robust and user-friendly.
