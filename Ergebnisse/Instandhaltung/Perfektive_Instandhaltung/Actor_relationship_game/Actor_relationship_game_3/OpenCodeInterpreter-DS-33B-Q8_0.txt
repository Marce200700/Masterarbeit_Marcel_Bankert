> The Actor Relationship Game is a Java-based application that allows users to explore connections between popular actors through their movie collaborations, using data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API. It constructs an actor graph and identifies the shortest path of relationships between any two actors.
I would like to change the code. I want you to add proper exception handling inside the 'findConnections' function for the case that an IOException occurs.
Here is the current implementation of this function:
\
public void findConnections(List<String[]> actorPairs, String outputFilePath) {
        PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(outputFilePath))
            for (String[] pair : actorPairs) {
                if (pair.length != 2) {
                    System.out.println("Invalid actor pair. Skipping.");
                    continue;
                }

                String actor1Name = pair[0];
                String actor2Name = pair[1];

                // Assuming getActorIdByName is a method in ActorGraph that returns the actor's ID given a name
                String actor1Id = actorGraph.getActorIdByName(actor1Name);
                String actor2Id = actorGraph.getActorIdByName(actor2Name);

                if (actor1Id == null || actor2Id == null) {
                    writer.println("One or both actors not found in the graph.");
                    continue;
                }

                List<Map.Entry<String, String>> connectionPath = actorGraph.findConnectionWithPath(actor1Id, actor2Id);

                if (connectionPath.isEmpty()) {
                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println("No connection found between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ".");
                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println();
                } else {
                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println("Connection Number between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ":" + (connectionPath.size() - 1));
                    writer.println("Connection path between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ":");
                    for (int i = 0; i < connectionPath.size(); i++) {
                        Map.Entry<String, String> step = connectionPath.get(i);
                        writer.println((i + 1) + ". " + step.getKey() + ": " + step.getValue());
                    }
                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println();
                }
            }
    }I understand your requirements. To handle IOException, we should catch the exception and log the error message, preventing the program from terminating abruptly. Here's an adjusted implementation:

```java
public void findConnections(List<String[]> actorPairs, String outputFilePath) {
    try(PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(outputFilePath))){
        for(String[] pair : actorPairs) {
            if(pair.length != 2) {
                System.out.println("Invalid actor pair. Skipping.");
                continue;
            }

            String actor1Name = pair[0];
            String actor2Name = pair[1];

            // Assuming getActorIdByName is a method in ActorGraph that returns the actor's ID given a name
            String actor1Id = actorGraph.getActorIdByName(actor1Name);
            String actor2Id = actorGraph.getActorIdByName(actor2Name);

            if(actor1Id == null || actor2Id == null) {
                writer.println("One or both actors not found in the graph.");
                continue;
            }

            List<Map.Entry<String, String>> connectionPath = actorGraph.findConnectionWithPath(actor1Id, actor2Id);

            if(connectionPath.isEmpty()) {
                writer.println("================================
>
===================");
                writer.println("No connection found between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ".");
                writer.println("===================================================");
                writer.println();
            } else {
                writer.println("===================================================");
                writer.println("Connection Number between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ":" + (connectionPath.size() - 1));
                writer.println("Connection path between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ":");
                for(int i = 0; i < connectionPath.size(); i++) {
                    Map.Entry<String, String> step = connectionPath.get(i);
                    writer.println((i + 1) + ". " + step.getKey() + ": " + step.getValue());
                }
                writer.println("===================================================");
                writer.println();
            }
        }
    } catch(IOException e) {
        System.out.println("An error occurred while trying to write to the file: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This version of the code will catch any IOException that might occur when writing to the file and print an error message instead of terminating the program.
