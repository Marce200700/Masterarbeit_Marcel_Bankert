> The Actor Relationship Game is a Java-based application that allows users to explore connections between popular actors through their movie collaborations, using data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API. It constructs an actor graph and identifies the shortest path of relationships between any two actors.
I would like to change the code. I want you to add proper exception handling inside the 'findConnections' function for the case that an IOException occurs.
Here is the current implementation of this function:
\
public void findConnections(List<String[]> actorPairs, String outputFilePath) {
        PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(outputFilePath))
            for (String[] pair : actorPairs) {
                if (pair.length != 2) {
                    System.out.println("Invalid actor pair. Skipping.");
                    continue;
                }

                String actor1Name = pair[0];
                String actor2Name = pair[1];

                // Assuming getActorIdByName is a method in ActorGraph that returns the actor's ID given a name
                String actor1Id = actorGraph.getActorIdByName(actor1Name);
                String actor2Id = actorGraph.getActorIdByName(actor2Name);

                if (actor1Id == null || actor2Id == null) {
                    writer.println("One or both actors not found in the graph.");
                    continue;
                }

                List<Map.Entry<String, String>> connectionPath = actorGraph.findConnectionWithPath(actor1Id, actor2Id);

                if (connectionPath.isEmpty()) {
                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println("No connection found between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ".");
                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println();
                } else {
                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println("Connection Number between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ":" + (connectionPath.size() - 1));
                    writer.println("Connection path between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ":");
                    for (int i = 0; i < connectionPath.size(); i++) {
                        Map.Entry<String, String> step = connectionPath.get(i);
                        writer.println((i + 1) + ". " + step.getKey() + ": " + step.getValue());
                    }
                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println();
                }
            }
    }Here's how you can modify the `findConnections` function to include proper exception handling for the case that an `IOException

` occurs:

```java
public void findConnections(List<String[]> actorPairs, String outputFilePath) {
    try (PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(outputFilePath))) {
        for (String[] pair : actorPairs) {
            if (pair.length != 2) {
                System.out.println("Invalid actor pair. Skipping.");
                continue;
            }

            String actor1Name = pair[0];
            String actor2Name = pair[1];

            // Assuming getActorIdByName is a method in ActorGraph that returns the actor's ID given a name
            String actor1Id = actorGraph.getActorIdByName(actor1Name);
            String actor2Id = actorGraph.getActorIdByName(actor2Name);

            if (actor1Id == null || actor2Id == null) {
                writer.println("One or both actors not found in the graph.");
                continue;
            }

            List<Map.Entry<String, String>> connectionPath = actorGraph.findConnectionWithPath(actor1Id, actor2Id);

            if (connectionPath.isEmpty()) {
                writer.println("===================================================");
                writer.println("No connection found between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ".");
                writer.println("===================================================");
                writer.println();
            } else {
                writer.println("===================================================");
                writer.println("Connection Number between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ":" + (connectionPath.size() - 1));
                writer.println("Connection path between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ":");
                for (int i = 0; i < connectionPath.size(); i++) {
                    Map.Entry<String, String> step = connectionPath.get(i);
                    writer.println((i + 1) + ". " + step.getKey() + ": " + step.getValue());
                }
                writer.println("===================================================");
                writer.println();
            }
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        System.err.println("Error writing to output file: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

Here's what changed:

1. I wrapped the `PrintWriter` creation in a try-with-resources statement, which ensures that the `PrintWriter` is properly closed at the end of the block, regardless of whether an exception occurs.
2. I added a catch block to handle the `IOException` that might be thrown when writing to the output file. If an exception occurs, I print an error message to the standard error stream.

Note that

 you might want to handle the exception differently, depending on your application's requirements. For example, you could rethrow the exception, log the error, or display an error message to the user.

Additionally, you might want to consider logging the exception instead of just printing it. This can be done using a logging framework such as Log4j or Java Util Logging. Here's an example:

```java
import java.util.logging.Logger;

// ...

private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(YourClass.class.getName());

// ...

} catch (IOException e) {
    logger.severe("Error writing to output file: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

This way, the error message will be logged and can be easily configured to be written to a log file or displayed in a log console.

Also, you might want to consider adding a finally block to close the writer in case of an exception, but since you are using try-with-resources statement, the writer will be automatically closed at the end of the block, regardless of whether an exception is thrown.

You can also add a custom message to the exception to provide more context about what went wrong, like this:

```java
} catch (IOException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Failed to write to output file: " + outputFilePath, e);
}
```

This way, you can provide more information about what file was being written to when the exception occurred.
