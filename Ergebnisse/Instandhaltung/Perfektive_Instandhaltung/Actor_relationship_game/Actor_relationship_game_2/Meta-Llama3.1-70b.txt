> The Actor Relationship Game is a Java-based application that allows users to explore connections between popular actors through their movie collaborations, using data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API. It constructs an actor graph and identifies the shortest path of relationships between any two actors.
I would like to add a new functionality. So the connections are generated and written down in a generated text file.
I now want to document amount of connection between two actors. To do so, I want you to tell me which file has to be changed.
Here is the file tree of this project:

```To document the amount of connections between two actors, I would recommend modifying the `GraphCreation.java` file.

This file is likely responsible for constructing the actor graph and identifying the shortest path of relationships between any two actors. By modifying this file, you can add the functionality to write the connection data to a generated text file.

Specifically, you may want to look for the method(s) that perform the graph
>
 construction and shortest path calculation, and add code to write the connection data to a file. You may also want to consider adding a new method or class to handle the file writing functionality.

Some potential approaches to consider:

* Add a new method to `GraphCreation.java` that takes two actors as input and writes the connection data to a file.
* Modify the existing graph construction method(s) to also write the connection data to a file.
* Create a new class, e.g. `ConnectionWriter.java`, that is responsible for writing the connection data to a file, and call it from `GraphCreation.java`.

Let me know if you'd like more specific guidance or help with implementing the changes!

If you need help with implementing the changes, please let me know what programming language you're using and what specific functionality you're trying to add, and I'll do my best to provide a step-by-step guide.

Here is the rest of the modified `GameplayInterface.java` file:

```java
    private static List<String[]> generateAllActorPairs(String fileName) {
        List<String> actors = readActorsFromFile(fileName);
        List<String[]> pairs = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < actors.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < actors.size(); j++) {
                pairs.add(new String[]{actors.get(i), actors.get(j)});

        gameplay.loadGraph(graphPath);

        gameplay.findConnections(actorPairs,filePath);
        gameplay.writeConnectionCounts(actorPairs, connectionCountPath);
    }
}
```

You'll need to add a new argument to the `main` method to specify the file path where the connection counts will be written.

You can run the program with the following command:

```
java GameplayInterface graph_file_path actor_file_path output_file_path connection_count_file_path
```

For example:

```
java GameplayInterface graph.ser actors.txt output.txt connection_counts.csv
```

This will write the connection counts to a file named `connection_counts.csv` in the same directory. The file will contain the actor pairs and their corresponding connection counts, separated by commas.
