> The Actor Relationship Game is a Java-based application that allows users to explore connections between popular actors through their movie collaborations, using data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API. It constructs an actor graph and identifies the shortest path of relationships between any two actors.
I would like to add a new functionality. So the connections are generated and written down in a generated text file.
I now want to document amount of connection between two actors. To do so, I want you to tell me which file has to be changed.
Here is the file tree of this project:

The file you would likely need to change to document the amount of connections between two actors is ActorGraph.java. This file probably contains the logic for creating the graph and finding paths between actors. You could modify this file to keep track of the number of connections between each pair of actors and then write this information to the text file.

Here's a high-level overview of how you might modify the ActorGraph class:

1. Create a new instance variable to store a data structure that can hold the number of connections between each pair of actors. A HashMap<Pair<Actor, Actor>, Integer> might be a suitable choice.

2. Modify the method that adds edges to the graph (probably addEdge in ActorGraph) to increment the corresponding value in the HashMap each time an edge is added.

3. Modify the method that writes the graph to a file (probably writeGraphToFile in ActorGraph) to also write the number of connections between each pair of actors to the file.

4. Write tests for the new functionality to ensure it works correctly. You might want to add tests to ActorGraphTest.java to test the new methods and instance variables.

Please note that I'm not able to edit the files directly, I can only suggest how to approach the problem.

> Ok I want to change the GameplayInterface.java file. Here is the current code of this file: package Actor_relationship_game;

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.util.List;

public class GameplayInterface {
    private ActorGraph actorGraph;

    public void setActorGraph(ActorGraph actorGraph) {
        this.actorGraph = actorGraph;
    }


    public void loadGraph(String fileName) {
        try (FileInputStream fileIn = new FileInputStream(fileName);
             ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(fileIn)) {
            actorGraph = (ActorGraph) in.readObject();
            System.out.println("Graph successfully loaded.");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public void findConnections(List<String[]> actorPairs, String outputFilePath) {
        try (PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(outputFilePath))) {
            for (String[] pair : actorPairs) {
                if (pair.length != 2) {
                    System.out.println("Invalid actor pair. Skipping.");
                    continue;
                }

                String actor1Name = pair[0];
                String actor2Name = pair[1];

                // Assuming getActorIdByName is a method in ActorGraph that returns the actor's ID given a name
                String actor1Id = actorGraph.getActorIdByName(actor1Name);
                String actor2Id = actorGraph.getActorIdByName(actor2Name);

                if (actor1Id == null || actor2Id == null) {
                    writer.println("One or both actors not found in the graph.");
                    continue;
                }

                List<Map.Entry<String, String>> connectionPath = actorGraph.findConnectionWithPath(actor1Id, actor2Id);

                if (connectionPath.isEmpty()) {
                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println("No connection found between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ".");
                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println();
                } else {
                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println("Connection path between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ":");
                    for (int i = 0; i < connectionPath.size(); i++) {
                        Map.Entry<String, String> step = connectionPath.get(i);
                        writer.println((i + 1) + ". " + step.getKey() + ": " + step.getValue());
                    }
                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println();
                }
            }
        } catch (IOException e){
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }


    private static List<String> readActorsFromFile(String fileName) {
        List<String> actors = new ArrayList<>();
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                actors.add(line.trim());
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        return actors;
    }

    private static List<String[]> generateAllActorPairs(String fileName) {
        List<String> actors = readActorsFromFile(fileName);
        List<String[]> pairs = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < actors.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < actors.size(); j++) {
                pairs.add(new String[]{actors.get(i), actors.get(j)});
            }
        }

        return pairs;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String graphPath = args[0];
        String actorPath = args[1];
        String filePath = args[2];

        GameplayInterface gameplay = new GameplayInterface();
        gameplay.loadGraph(graphPath);

        List<String[]> actorPairs = generateAllActorPairs(actorPath);
        gameplay.findConnections(actorPairs,filePath);
    }
}


Which function should be change to implement the aforementioned functionality?

> The `findConnections` method in the GameplayInterface class is the one that should be changed to implement the functionality you've described. This method currently finds the connection path between each pair of actors and writes it to a file. You can modify this method to also write the number of connections between each pair of actors to the file.

Here's a high-level overview of how you might modify the `findConnections` method:

1. After finding the connection path between each pair of actors, calculate the number of connections by taking the size of the connection path.

2. Write this number of connections to the file, along with the connection path. You can do this by adding a line to write the number of connections to the PrintWriter object, something like `writer.println("Number of connections: " + connectionPath.size());`.

3. Write tests for the new functionality to ensure it works correctly. You might want to add tests to GameplayInterfaceTest.java to test the modified `findConnections` method.
