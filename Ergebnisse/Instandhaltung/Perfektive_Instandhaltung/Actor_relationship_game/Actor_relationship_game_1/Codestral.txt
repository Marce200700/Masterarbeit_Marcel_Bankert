> The Actor Relationship Game is a Java-based application that allows users to explore connections between popular actors through their movie collaborations, using data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API. It constructs an actor graph and identifies the shortest path of relationships between any two actors.
I would like to add a new functionality. So the connections are generated and written down in a generated text file.
I now want to document the case that no connections between two actors are found. To do so, I want you to tell me which file has to be changed.
Here is the file tree of this project:

From the information provided, it seems that you want to modify the functionality of the Actor Relationship Game to document cases when no connections are found between two actors. The relevant class for this modification would likely be `ActorGraphUtil.java` as it is responsible for finding the shortest path between actors in the graph.

Here's a high-level approach:

1. Identify the method in `ActorGraphUtil.java` that is responsible for finding the shortest path between two actors.
2. Modify this method to return a special value or throw an exception when no path is found.
3. In your `GameplayInterface.java` or any other class that uses `ActorGraphUtil.java`, you should catch this exception and write a message to a text file documenting that no connections were found between the two actors.

For writing to a text file, you can use Java's built-in `FileWriter` or `BufferedWriter` classes. Remember to handle any exceptions that may occur during file writing, such as `IOException`.

You might also want to consider adding a test case in `ActorGraphUtilTest.java` to ensure that your modification works as expected.

Remember to commit your changes and push them to your Git repository after making these modifications.

> Ok I want to change the GameplayInterface.java file. Here is the current code of this file:package Actor_relationship_game;

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.util.List;

public class GameplayInterface {
    private ActorGraph actorGraph;

    public void setActorGraph(ActorGraph actorGraph) {
        this.actorGraph = actorGraph;
    }


    public void loadGraph(String fileName) {
        try (FileInputStream fileIn = new FileInputStream(fileName);
             ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(fileIn)) {
            actorGraph = (ActorGraph) in.readObject();
            System.out.println("Graph successfully loaded.");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public void findConnections(List<String[]> actorPairs, String outputFilePath) {
        try (PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(outputFilePath))) {
            for (String[] pair : actorPairs) {
                if (pair.length != 2) {
                    System.out.println("Invalid actor pair. Skipping.");
                    continue;
                }

                String actor1Name = pair[0];
                String actor2Name = pair[1];

                // Assuming getActorIdByName is a method in ActorGraph that returns the actor's ID given a name
                String actor1Id = actorGraph.getActorIdByName(actor1Name);
                String actor2Id = actorGraph.getActorIdByName(actor2Name);

                if (actor1Id == null || actor2Id == null) {
                    writer.println("One or both actors not found in the graph.");
                    continue;
                }

                List<Map.Entry<String, String>> connectionPath = actorGraph.findConnectionWithPath(actor1Id, actor2Id);

                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println("Connection Number between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ":" + (connectionPath.size() - 1));
                    writer.println("Connection path between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name + ":");
                    for (int i = 0; i < connectionPath.size(); i++) {
                        Map.Entry<String, String> step = connectionPath.get(i);
                        writer.println((i + 1) + ". " + step.getKey() + ": " + step.getValue());
                    }
                    writer.println("===================================================");
                    writer.println();

            }
        } catch (IOException e){
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }


    private static List<String> readActorsFromFile(String fileName) {
        List<String> actors = new ArrayList<>();

            }
        } catch (IOException e) {

        List<String[]> pairs = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < actors.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < actors.size(); j++) {
                pairs.add(new String[]{actors.get(i), actors.get(j)});
            }
        }

        return pairs;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String graphPath = args[0];
        String actorPath = args[1];
        String filePath = args[2];

        GameplayInterface gameplay = new GameplayInterface();
        gameplay.loadGraph(graphPath);

        List<String[]> actorPairs = generateAllActorPairs(actorPath);
        gameplay.findConnections(actorPairs,filePath);
    }
}


Which function should be change to implement the aforementioned functionality?
>
From the provided code, it seems that the `findConnections` method is responsible for finding the connection path between two actors and writing the results to a file.

To implement the functionality of documenting cases when no connections are found between two actors, you should modify the `findConnections` method. You should check if the `connectionPath` is null or empty, and if so, write a message to the file documenting that no connections were found.

Here's a suggested modification:

```java
List<Map.Entry<String, String>> connectionPath = actorGraph.findConnectionWithPath(actor1Id, actor2Id);

if (connectionPath == null || connectionPath.isEmpty()) {
    writer.println("===================================================");
    writer.println("No connections found between " + actor1Name + " and " + actor2Name);
    writer.println("===================================================");
    writer.println();
    continue;
}
```

This modification checks if the `connectionPath` is null or empty, and if so, writes a message to the file documenting that no connections were found. The `continue` statement is used to skip to the next iteration of the loop, avoiding unnecessary processing for this pair of actors.
