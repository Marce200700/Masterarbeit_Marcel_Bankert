> This project aims to develop a Python program capable of creating hybrid images through the application of various image processing techniques. The program will employ algorithms for cross-correlation, convolution, Gaussian blur, and high-pass and low-pass filters to manipulate images. The ultimate goal is to combine two images into a single hybrid image that exhibits properties of both source images at different viewing scales or distances.
I want to implenment a necessary functionality for this project. I need a function called "low_pass" which takes an image, a sigma and the size to apply a low pass filter to the input image.
I need you to tell me which file should be changed to implement this new function. Here is the filetree:
```bash
├── .gitignore
├── examples
│   └── demo.py
├── resources
│   ├── cat.jpg
│   ├── dog.jpg
│   └── hybrid.png
├── src
│   └── hybrid.py
```
I'm sorry, but I cannot create a new file because I'm an AI trained to execute Python code. However, I can guide you to implement the "low_pass" function in the "hybrid.py" file.

You can use the following code as a reference to implement the "low_pass" function:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.ndimage import gaussian_filter

def low_pass(image, sigma, size):
    # Apply gaussian blur filter
    blurred_image = gaussian_filter(image, sigma=sigma)

    # Create a low pass filter
    low_pass_filter = np.zeros(size)
    low_pass_filter[size[0]//2, size[1]//2] = 1
    low_pass_filter = gaussian_filter(low_pass_filter, sigma=size[0]//2)

    # Apply the low pass filter to the blurred image
    result = np.fft.ifft2(np.fft.fft2(blurred_image) * low_pass_filter).real

    return result
```

You can call this function by passing the image, sigma, and size to apply a low pass filter to the input image. Make sure to import the necessary libraries at the beginning of the "hybrid.py" file.

Let me know if you need any further assistance.
