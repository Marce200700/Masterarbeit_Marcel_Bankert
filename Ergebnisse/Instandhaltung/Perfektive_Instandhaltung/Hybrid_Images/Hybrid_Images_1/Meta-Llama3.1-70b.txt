> This project aims to develop a Python program capable of creating hybrid images through the application of various image processing techniques. The program will employ algorithms for cross-correlation, convolution, Gaussian blur, and high-pass and low-pass filters to manipulate images. The ultimate goal is to combine two images into a single hybrid image that exhibits properties of both source images at different viewing scales or distances.
I want to implenment a necessary functionality for this project. I need a function called "low_pass" which takes an image, a sigma and the size to apply a low pass filter to the input image.
I need you to tell me which file should be changed to implement this new function. Here is the filetree:
```bash
├── .gitignore
├── examples
│   └── demo.py
├── resources
│   ├── cat.jpg
│   ├── dog.jpg
│   └── hybrid.png
├── src
│   └── hybrid.py
```
To implement the `low_pass` function, you should modify the `hybrid.py` file located in the `src` directory.

This file appears to be the primary location for the project's source code, and adding the `low_pass` function there will allow you to easily import and use it in other parts of the project, such as the `demo.py` file in the `examples` directory.

So, the file to be changed is:
```bash
src/hybrid.py
```

Here is the implementation of the `low_pass` function:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def low_pass(image, sigma, size):
    """
    Apply a low-pass filter to the input image.

    Parameters:
    image (numpy array): Input image
    sigma (float): Standard deviation for the Gaussian kernel
    size (int): Size of the Gaussian kernel

    Returns:
    numpy array: Filtered image
    """
    # Create a Gaussian kernel with the specified size and sigma
    kernel = cv2.getGaussianKernel(size, sigma)
    kernel = np.outer(kernel, kernel)

    # Apply the Gaussian filter to the image
    filtered_image = cv2.filter2D(image, -1, kernel)

    return filtered_image
```

This implementation uses OpenCV's `getGaussianKernel` function to create a Gaussian kernel with the specified size and sigma. It then applies this kernel to the input image
