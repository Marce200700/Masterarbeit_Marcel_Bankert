 The errors you're encountering are due to a simple indentation issue in your Python code. The line `return output / normalize` is not properly indented within the function or method it belongs to. This leads to an `IndentationError` because Python expects all code within a block (like a function or a class) to be properly indented.

Let's take a look at the problematic line and how to fix it.

### Problem Code

The problematic line is:

```python
return output / normalize
```

This line is inside a function or method, but it is not properly indented to be part of that function or method.

### Fixing the Indentation Error

To fix the indentation error, you need to ensure that the line is properly indented within the function or method. Here's an example of how you might correct the code:

#### Example of a Corrected Function

```python
def create_hybrid_image(low_frequencies, high_frequencies):
    # Your function implementation here
    output = low_frequencies + high_frequencies  # Example operation
    normalize = ...  # Example normalization factor
    return output / normalize
```

In this example, `create_hybrid_image` is a function, and `return output / normalize` is properly indented within that function.

### Applying the Fix

Now, you need to go through your entire codebase and ensure that all similar lines are properly indented. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Locate the File with the Issue**: Open the file where the indentation error occurs.
2. **Correct the Indentation**: Ensure that the line `return output / normalize` is properly indented within the function or method it belongs to.
3. **Repeat for All Relevant Files**: Check all the files in your project where similar issues might occur.

### Example of a Corrected File

Here's an example of a corrected version of the `hybrid.py` file, where the function `create_hybrid_image` is properly indented:

```python
def create_hybrid_image(low_frequencies, high_frequencies):
    output = low_frequencies + high_frequencies
    normalize = ...  # Example normalization factor
    return output / normalize
```
