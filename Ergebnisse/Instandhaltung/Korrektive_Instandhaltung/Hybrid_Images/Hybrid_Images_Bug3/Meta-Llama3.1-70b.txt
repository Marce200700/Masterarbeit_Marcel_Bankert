Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.The errors you're encountering are all related to an indentation issue in your `hybrid.py`

 file, specifically at line 96.

Here is the problematic line of code:

```python
return output / normalize
```

The issue here is that this line is indented incorrectly.

In Python, indentation is crucial because it defines the grouping of statements. The indentation error occurs when the indentation is not consistent or is not in line with the expected indentation of the Python interpreter.

To fix this bug, you should correct the indentation of the line.

Assuming this line is inside a function or a conditional block, it should be indented to match the indentation of the surrounding code.

For example, if the surrounding code is indented 4 spaces, this line should also be indented 4 spaces:

```python
def some_function():
    ...
    return output / normalize
```

Or, if this line is not inside any block, it should have no indentation at all:

```python
return output / normalize
```

However, since the line is in the `hybrid.py` file and it's being imported in `unit_test.py`, `acceptance_test.py` and `demo.py`, you need to correct the indentation in `hybrid.py`.

Here is how you can do it:

Open your `hybrid.py` file, go to line 96 and correct the indentation of the line to match the surrounding code.

Here's an example:

```python
# hybrid.py

def create_hybrid_image():
    ...
    output = ...  # some calculation
    normalize = ...  # some calculation
    return output / normalize  # corrected indentation
```

After correcting the indentation in `hybrid.py`, the errors in `unit_test.py`, `acceptance_test.py` and `demo.py` should be resolved, and you should be able to run your tests and demo without encountering any indentation errors.
