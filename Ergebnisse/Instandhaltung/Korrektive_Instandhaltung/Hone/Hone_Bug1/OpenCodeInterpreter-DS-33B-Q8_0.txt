Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.

It seems like the problem is in the `get_leaves` method in your `Hone` class. The error message says `'str' object has no attribute 'items'`, which means the program is trying to access the `items` method of a string, which is not allowed in Python.

To fix this problem, you need to check if the `structure` is a dictionary before trying to call the `items` method. You can do this by adding a condition to check the type of `structure` before calling `items`. Here's an updated version of the `get_leaves` method:

```python
def get_leaves(self, structure):
    if isinstance(structure, dict):
        mapping = {}
        for k, v in structure.items():
            if isinstance(v, dict):
                mapping[k] = self.get_leaves(v)
            else:
                mapping[k] = v
        return mapping
    else:
        return structure
```

With this change, the program should no longer raise an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `items` method of a string.

Please note that you should update the code in your `Hone` class and rerun the tests to verify that the errors are fixed. Let me know if you need any further assistance.

> Ok I have tried your implementation and it does not work. Maybe another Method is responsible for the problem. Do you have a clue?
I'm sorry for the confusion, but it seems there's an error that isn't related to the `get_leaves` method. The error is `'str' object has no attribute 'items'`, which means the program is trying to access the `items` method of a string, which is not allowed in Python.

Here's an overview of the code in your `Hone` class:

```python
def get_leaves(self, structure):
    mapping = {}
    for k, v in structure.items():
        if isinstance(v, dict):
            mapping[k] = self.get_leaves(v)
        else:
            mapping[k] = v
    return
