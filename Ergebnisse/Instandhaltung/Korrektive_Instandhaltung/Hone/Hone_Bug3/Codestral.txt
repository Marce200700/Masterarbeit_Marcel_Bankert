Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.

The error you're encountering is a `KeyError` which means that the key 'adopted_since' is not found in the dictionary `mapping`. This error is raised when you try to access a key that is not present in the dictionary.

The key 'adopted_since' is being accessed in the `populate_structure_with_data` method of the `Hone` class in the `hone.py` file.

To fix this error, you need to ensure that 'adopted_since' is a key in the `mapping` dictionary. You can do this by checking if the key exists in the dictionary before trying to access it.

Here's how you can modify the `populate_structure_with_data` method to handle this:

```python
def populate_structure_with_data(self, column_schema, column_names, data):
    json_struct = []
    for row in data:
        entry = {}
        for i, column_name in enumerate(column_names):
            if column_name in mapping:  # Check if the key exists in the mapping
                key_path = mapping[column_name]
                self.set_nested_value(entry, key_path, row[i])
            else:
                print(f"KeyError: '{column_name}' not found in mapping")
        json_struct.append(entry)
    return json_struct
```

In this modification, the code checks if `column_name` is in the `mapping` dictionary before trying to access it. If the key is not found, it prints an error message and continues with the next column. This way, the `KeyError` is avoided, and the program can continue running even if it encounters an unexpected column name.

You should also investigate why 'adopted_since' is missing from the `mapping` dictionary. It might be a mistake in your code, or it might be that the 'adopted_since' column is not needed for the current operation.

> Can you provide a different solution to fix this issue?
 Of course!

Since the `KeyError` is occurring when trying to access `mapping[column_name]`, it's possible that the error is not in the `populate_structure_with_data` method, but in how `mapping` is being populated.

The error message "KeyError: 'adopted_since'" suggests that the 'adopted_since' key is not present in the `mapping` dictionary. This could be because `mapping` is not being correctly populated, or because 'adopted_since' is not a valid column name in the CSV file.

To debug this issue, you can add some print statements to see the contents of `mapping` and `column_names` before the error occurs. This can help you determine whether the problem is with the `mapping` dictionary or with the CSV file.

Here's an example of how you can modify the `convert` method to print these values:

```python
def convert(self, csv_filepath):
    print("Column names:", self.column_names)
    print("Mapping:", self.mapping)
    column_schema = self.get_column_schema(csv_filepath)
    data = self.load_csv_data(csv_filepath)
    json_struct = self.populate_structure_with_data(column_schema, self.column_names, data)
    return json_struct
```

With these modifications, you should be able to see the contents of `mapping` and `column_names` in the console output. If you see that 'adopted_since' is a valid column name in the CSV file, but it's not present in the `mapping` dictionary, then the problem is likely with how `mapping` is being populated.

If 'adopted_since' is not a valid column name in the CSV file, then the problem is either with the CSV file or with how `column_names` is being populated. You can check the CSV file to make sure it contains the expected columns, and you can modify the `get_column_
> I tried the code and as it turns out the column name 'adopted_since' is valid, because it can be found inside the respective csv-files. However the column does not exist inside the dictionary. Do you know which method other than ''populate_structure_with_data' might cause the 'adopted_since' column to be missing?
 Based on the information you've provided, it seems that the 'adopted_since' column is missing from the `mapping` dictionary. This dictionary is used to map column names to their corresponding keys in the JSON structure.

The `mapping` dictionary is likely being populated in the `__init__` method of the `Hone` class, or in another method that is called when an instance of the `Hone` class is created. You can check this method to see if 'adopted_since' is being added to the `mapping` dictionary.

If 'adopted_since' is not being added to the `mapping` dictionary, you can add it manually in the `__init__` method or in another appropriate place in the code. Here's an example of how you can add 'adopted_since' to the `mapping` dictionary:

```python
class Hone:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mapping = {
            'column_name_1': 'key_1',
            'column_name_2': 'key_2',
            # Add 'adopted_since' to the mapping dictionary
            'adopted_since': 'adopted_since'
        }
```

In this example, the key and value for 'adopted_since' are the same. You can modify this as needed to match the desired JSON structure.

If 'adopted_since' is being added to the `mapping` dictionary, but it's still missing when the `populate_structure_with_data` method is called, then the problem might be with how the `mapping` dictionary is being used. You can check the other methods that use `mapping` to see if there are any issues that might cause 'adopted_since' to be missing.
