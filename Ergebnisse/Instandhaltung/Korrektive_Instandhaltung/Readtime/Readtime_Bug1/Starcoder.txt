Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.Thanks for the issue report.

To help you out you can use the following variables:

reading_time_text: 2
reading_time_html: 1
reading_time_markdown: 1<|im_end|>

You can use the following function to get an reading time estimate for your text.

```python
>>> from readtime import of_text, of_html, of_markdown
>>> reading_time_text = of_text("The shortest blog post in the world!")
>>> reading_time_html = of_html("This is <strong>HTML</strong>")
>>> reading_time_markdown = of_markdown("This is **Markdown**")
```
