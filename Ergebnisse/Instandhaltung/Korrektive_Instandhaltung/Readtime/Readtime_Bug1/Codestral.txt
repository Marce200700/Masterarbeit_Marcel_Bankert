    reading_time_markdown = of_markdow("This is **Markdown**")
NameError: name 'of_markdow' is not defined. Did you mean: 'of_markdown'?
Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.It seems like there is a typo in your code. You have defined a function called 'of_markdown' but you are trying to call a function named 'of_markdow'. To fix this, you should change 'of_markdow' to 'of_markdown' in your code. Here is the corrected line:

```python
reading_time_markdown = of_markdown("This is **Markdown**")
```

This should resolve the NameError you are experiencing.
