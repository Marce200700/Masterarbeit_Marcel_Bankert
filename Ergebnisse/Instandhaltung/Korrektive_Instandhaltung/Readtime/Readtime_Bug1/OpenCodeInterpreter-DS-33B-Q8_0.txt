> I get the following errors trying to run unit- and acceptance-tests for a program:
First:

marcel@LAPTOP-3IIA7HT1:/mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32/workspace/masterarbeit/DevBench/benchmark_data/python/readtime/examples$ python3 demo.py

Text: The shortest blog post in the world!
Text Reading Time (in seconds): 2
Text Reading Time (in text): 1 min

HTML: This is <strong>HTML</strong>
HTML Reading Time (in seconds): 1
HTML Reading Time (in text): 1 min

Markdown: This is **Markdown**
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32/workspace/masterarbeit/DevBench/benchmark_data/python/readtime/examples/demo.py", line 14, in <module>
    reading_time_markdown = of_markdow("This is **Markdown**")
NameError: name 'of_markdow' is not defined. Did you mean: 'of_markdown'?
Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.I apologize for the confusion. The 'of_markdow' function is not defined in the code, and the correct function name is 'of_markdown'. The error message also suggests that this function could be the cause of the problem.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from readtime import of_text
from readtime import of_html
from readtime import of_markdown

text = "The shortest blog post in the world!"
reading_time_text = of_text(text)
print(f"Text: {text}")
print(f"Text Reading Time (in seconds): {reading_time_text.seconds}")
print(f"Text Reading Time (in text): {reading_
>
time_text.text}")

html = "This is <strong>HTML</strong>"
reading_time_html = of_html(html)
print(f"\nHTML: {html}")
print(f"HTML Reading Time (in seconds): {reading_time_html.seconds}")
print(f"HTML Reading Time (in text): {reading_time_html.text}")

markdown = "This is **Markdown**"
reading_time_markdown = of_markdown(markdown)
print(f"\nMarkdown: {markdown}")
print(f"Markdown Reading Time (in seconds): {reading_time_markdown.seconds}")
print(f"Markdown Reading Time (in text): {reading_time_markdown.text}")
```

This script now correctly defines the functions and calls them with the required arguments. It will print the reading times for the provided texts and HTML string. Please try running the corrected code.
