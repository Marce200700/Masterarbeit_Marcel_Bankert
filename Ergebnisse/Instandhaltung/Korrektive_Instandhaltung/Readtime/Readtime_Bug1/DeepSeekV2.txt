> I get the following errors trying to run unit- and acceptance-tests for a program:
First:

marcel@LAPTOP-3IIA7HT1:/mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32/workspace/masterarbeit/DevBench/benchmark_data/python/readtime/examples$ python3 demo.py

Text: The shortest blog post in the world!
Text Reading Time (in seconds): 2
Text Reading Time (in text): 1 min

HTML: This is <strong>HTML</strong>
HTML Reading Time (in seconds): 1
HTML Reading Time (in text): 1 min

Markdown: This is **Markdown**
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32/workspace/masterarbeit/DevBench/benchmark_data/python/readtime/examples/demo.py", line 14, in <module>
    reading_time_markdown = of_markdow("This is **Markdown**")
NameError: name 'of_markdow' is not defined. Did you mean: 'of_markdown'?
Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors. The error you're encountering is due to a typo in the function name. In Python, function names are case-sensitive, so `of_markdow` and `of_markdown` are considered different names. The correct function name should be `of_markdown`.

Here's the corrected code for your `demo.py` file:

```python
def of_markdown(text):
    # Placeholder for the actual implementation of the reading time calculation for Markdown
    return 1  # This is just a placeholder, replace with actual logic

def of_html(text):
    # Placeholder for the actual implementation of the reading time calculation for HTML
    return 1  # This is just a placeholder, replace with actual logic

# Testing the functions
reading_time_markdown = of_markdown("This is **Markdown**")
reading_time_html = of_html("This is <strong>HTML</strong>")

print(f"Text: This is **Markdown**")
print(f"

> Text Reading Time (in seconds): {reading_time_markdown}")
print(f"Text Reading Time (in text): {reading_time_markdown} min")

print(f"HTML: This is <strong>HTML</strong>")
print(f"HTML Reading Time (in seconds): {reading_time_html}")
print(f"HTML Reading Time (in text): {reading_time_html} min")
```

In this corrected code:
1. The function `of_markdow` has been renamed to `of_markdown`.
2. The `of_markdown` function is defined to calculate the reading time for Markdown text.
3. The `of_html` function is defined to calculate the reading time for HTML text.
4. The `demo.py` script tests these functions with sample text and prints the reading times.

Make sure you have the actual implementation of the reading time calculation logic inside the `of_markdown` and `of_html` functions. The placeholders `1` in the example are just placeholders and should be replaced with the actual logic to calculate the reading time.
