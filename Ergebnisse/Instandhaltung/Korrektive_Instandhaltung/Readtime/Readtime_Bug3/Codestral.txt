Custom WPM: The shortest blog post in the world! (WPM = 5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32/workspace/masterarbeit/DevBench/benchmark_data/python/readtime/examples/demo.py", line 19, in <module>
    reading_time_wpm = oftext("The shortest blog post in the world!", wpm=5)
NameError: name 'oftext' is not defined. Did you mean: 'of_text'?
Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.The error message indicates that the function `oftext` is not defined in the program. However, the correct function name is `of_text` as suggested in the error message.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from readtime import of_text

# Text
text = "The shortest blog post in the world!"
reading_time = of_text(text)
print("Text Reading Time (in seconds):", reading_time.seconds)
print("Text Reading Time (in text):", reading_time.text)

>

# HTML
html = "This is <strong>HTML</strong>"
reading_time = of_text(html, html=True)
print("HTML Reading Time (in seconds):", reading_time.seconds)
print("HTML Reading Time (in text):", reading_time.text)

# Markdown
markdown = "This is **Markdown**"
reading_time = of_text(markdown, markdown=True)
print("Markdown Reading Time (in seconds):", reading_time.seconds)
print("Markdown Reading Time (in text):", reading_time.text)

# Custom WPM
custom_wpm = 5
reading_time = of_text(text, wpm=custom_wpm)
print(f"Custom WPM: {text} (WPM = {custom_wpm})")
print("Reading Time (in seconds):", reading_time.seconds)
print("Reading Time (in text):", reading_time.text)
```

In the corrected code, I replaced `oftext` with `of_text` to match the correct function name. This should fix the `NameError` and allow the program to run without errors.
