Custom WPM: The shortest blog post in the world! (WPM = 5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32/workspace/masterarbeit/DevBench/benchmark_data/python/readtime/examples/demo.py", line 19, in <module>
    reading_time_wpm = oftext("The shortest blog post in the world!", wpm=5)
NameError: name 'oftext' is not defined. Did you mean: 'of_text'?
Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.The error message indicates that the function `oftext` is not defined. However, there is a suggestion in the error message that `of_text` might be the correct function name.

Looking at the code, it seems that the function name was previously `of_text`, but it was renamed to `oftext`. However, the function definition was not updated accordingly.

To fix the bug, you can simply update the function name in the function definition to match the function call. Here is the corrected code:

```python
# Replace this line
def oftext(text, wpm=None):
    # function implementation here
```

with

```python
# Replace this line
def of_text(text, wpm=None):
    # function implementation here
```

Alternatively, if you want to keep the function name as `oftext`, you can update the function call to match the function definition:

```python
# Replace this line
reading_time_wpm = of_text("The shortest blog post in the world!", wpm=5
>
)
```

with

```python
# Replace this line
reading_time_wpm = oftext("The shortest blog post in the world!", wpm=5)
```

Make sure to update the function name consistently throughout the code to avoid any further errors.

Here is the corrected code snippet:

```python
# Corrected code snippet
def of_text(text, wpm=None):
    # function implementation here

# ...

reading_time_wpm = of_text("The shortest blog post in the world!", wpm=5)
```

With this correction, the code should run without any errors.
