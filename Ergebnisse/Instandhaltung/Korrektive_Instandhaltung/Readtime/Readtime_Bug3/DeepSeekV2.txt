  File "/mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32/workspace/masterarbeit/DevBench/benchmark_data/python/readtime/examples/demo.py", line 19, in <module>
    reading_time_wpm = oftext("The shortest blog post in the world!", wpm=5) # Zuvor reading_time_wpm = of_text("The shortest blog post in the world!", wpm=5);
NameError: name 'oftext' is not defined. Did you mean: 'of_text'?
Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors. It looks like you're encountering a `NameError` because the function `oftext` is not defined in your script. The correct function to use is `of_text`. The error message suggests that you have a typo in the function name.

Here's the corrected version of your script:

```python
from readtime import of_text

# Text reading time
reading_time_text = of_text("The shortest blog post in the world!")
print(f"Text: The shortest blog post in the world!")
print(f"Text Reading Time (in seconds): {reading_time_text}")
print(f"Text Reading Time (in text): {reading_time_text // 60} min")

# HTML reading time
reading_
>
time_html = of_text("This is <strong>HTML</strong>", html=True)
print(f"\nHTML: This is <strong>HTML</strong>")
print(f"HTML Reading Time (in seconds): {reading_time_html}")
print(f"HTML Reading Time (in text): {reading_time_html // 60} min")

# Markdown reading time
reading_time_markdown = of_text("This is **Markdown**", markdown=True)
print(f"\nMarkdown: This is **Markdown**")
print(f"Markdown Reading Time (in seconds): {reading_time_markdown}")
print(f"Markdown Reading Time (in text): {reading_time_markdown // 60} min")

# Custom WPM reading time
reading_time_wpm = of_text("The shortest blog post in the world!", wpm=5)
print(f"\nCustom WPM: The shortest blog post in the world! (WPM = 5)")
print(f"Reading Time (in seconds): {reading_time_wpm}")
print(f"Reading Time (in text): {reading_time_wpm // 60} min")
```

Make sure you have the `readtime` package installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

```sh
pip install readtime
```

This script uses the `of_text` function from the `readtime` package to calculate the reading time for different types of text (plain text, HTML, and Markdown) and for a custom words per minute (WPM) value. The corrected function name should resolve the `NameError` you encountered.
