NameError: name 'oftext' is not defined. Did you mean: 'of_text'?
Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.It appears you're trying to call a function called `oftext`, but the function doesn't exist. Instead, you might be looking for the `of_text` function. The code you're trying to run is Python code and it seems to be part of the `readtime` library.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```python
from readtime import of_text

text_reading_time = of_text("The shortest blog post
>
 in the world!", wpm=300)
html_reading_time = of_text("This is <strong>HTML</strong>", wpm=300)
markdown_reading_time = of_text("This is **Markdown**", wpm=300)

print("Text: The shortest blog post in the world!")
print(f"Text Reading Time (in seconds): {text_reading_time.seconds}")
print(f"Text Reading Time (in text): {text_reading_time.text}")
print("")
print("HTML: This is <strong>HTML</strong>")
print(f"HTML Reading Time (in seconds): {html_reading_time.seconds}")
print(f"HTML Reading Time (in text): {html_reading_time.text}")
print("")
print("Markdown: This is **Markdown**")
print(f"Markdown Reading Time (in seconds): {markdown_reading_time.seconds}")
print(f"Markdown Reading Time (in text): {markdown_reading_time.text}")
```

In this code, we're importing the `of_text` function from the `readtime` library. We're then calculating the reading time for each of the specified types of texts: text, HTML, and Markdown.

Let's execute this corrected code.
```python
from readtime import of_text

text_reading_time = of_text('The shortest blog post in the world!', wpm=300)
html_reading_time = of_text('This is <strong>HTML</strong>', wpm=300)
markdown_reading_time = of_text('This is **Markdown**', wpm=300)

print('Text: The shortest blog post in the world!')
print(f'Text Reading Time (in seconds): {text_reading_time.seconds}')
print(f'Text Reading Time (in text): {text_reading_time.text}')
print('')
print('HTML: This is <strong>HTML</strong>')
print(f'HTML Reading Time (in seconds): {html_reading_
