Custom WPM: The shortest blog post in the world! (WPM = 5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32/workspace/masterarbeit/DevBench/benchmark_data/python/readtime/examples/demo.py", line 19, in <module>
    reading_time_wpm = oftext("The shortest blog post in the world!", wpm=5) # Zuvor reading_time_wpm = of_text("The shortest blog post in the world!", wpm=5);
NameError: name 'oftext' is not defined. Did you mean: 'of_text'?
Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.I have already looked at the file demo.py.
In line 19, you call the function "oftext" which does not exist.
It seems that you are trying to use the function "of_text" instead.<|im_end|>
