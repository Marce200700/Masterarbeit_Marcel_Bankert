> I get the following errors trying to run unit- and acceptance-tests for a program:
marcel@LAPTOP-3IIA7HT1:/mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32/workspace/masterarbeit/DevBench/benchmark_data/python/readtime/examples$ python3 demo.py

Text: The shortest blog post in the world!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32/workspace/masterarbeit/DevBench/benchmark_data/python/readtime/examples/demo.py", line 5, in <module>
    print("Text Reading Time (in seconds):", reading_time_text.seconds)
NameError: name 'reading_time_text' is not defined. Did you mean: 'reading_timetext'?
Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.I guess you forgot to define a variable:
reading_time_text = ReadingTime()
