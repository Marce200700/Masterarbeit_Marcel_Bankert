 The error message indicates that there is a `NullPointerException` in the `GraphCreation` class, specifically at line 57. This suggests that there is a null reference being accessed somewhere in the code at that line. Let's assume the file `GraphCreation.java` is part of the `Actor_relationship_game` package and look at the relevant code at line 57.

### Code Inspection

Let's assume the relevant code at line 57 in `GraphCreation.java` is something like this:

```java
// Assuming this is the line 57
String movieElement = actorElement.getChild("movie").getText();
```

This code attempts to get the text of a child element named "movie" from the `actorElement`. If `actorElement` is `null` or if the "movie" child does not exist, this will throw a `NullPointerException`.

### Possible Causes and Fixes

1. **Null `actorElement`**:
   - Ensure that `actorElement` is not `null` before accessing its children.

2. **Missing "movie" child**:
   - Check if the XML structure guarantees that every `actorElement` will have a "movie" child. If not, add a null check or handle the absence of the child appropriately.

### Suggested Fix

Let's add a null check around the line that accesses the "movie" child:

```java
// Before
String movieElement = actorElement.getChild("movie").getText();

// After
Element movieElementElement = actorElement.getChild("movie");
if (movieElementElement != null) {
    String movieElement = movieElementElement.getText();
} else {
    // Handle the case where the "movie" child does not exist
    System.out.println("Warning: No movie child found for actor.");
    movieElement = "Unknown"; // or some default value
}
```

### Additional Debugging Steps

1. **Check the Input Data**:
   - Ensure that the input XML data being processed by the script is correctly formatted and does not contain any null or missing elements.

2. **Logging**:
   - Add logging to understand which `actorElement` is causing the issue. This can help identify if there is a specific actor element that consistently causes the problem.

### Example of Adding Logging

> The line 57 looks like this: String movieId = movieObject.get("id2").getAsString(); does this help to fix the issue?
 Yes, the line `String movieId = movieObject.get("id2").getAsString();` suggests that you are trying to retrieve a movie ID from a JSON object. If `movieObject` is `null` or if the key "id2" does not exist in the JSON object, this will also throw a `NullPointerException`.

To fix the issue, you should add a null check around the line that accesses the movie ID:

```java
// Before
String movieId = movieObject.get("id2").getAsString();

// After
JsonElement idElement = movieObject.get("id2");
if (idElement != null && idElement.isJsonPrimitive() && idElement.getAsJsonPrimitive().isString()) {
    String movieId = idElement.getAsString();
} else {
    // Handle the case where "id2" does not exist or is not a string
    System.out.println("Warning: No valid 'id2' found for movie.");
    movieId = "Unknown"; // or some default value
}
```

This ensures that you only attempt to access the movie ID if it exists and is a string.

### Summary

- Ensure that all references are properly checked for nullity before accessing them.
- Add appropriate error handling or logging to understand where the issue might be occurring.
- Ensure that the input data is correctly formatted and complete.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the root cause of the `NullPointerException` and successfully run your unit and acceptance tests.

> Maybe 'id2' does not even refer to the correct key.
 If the key "id2" does not refer to the correct field in the JSON object, you should replace it with the correct key. However, if you are unsure about the correct key, you should first check the structure of the JSON data.

Assuming you have access to the JSON data, you can print out the keys or structure to understand the schema. This can be done using a JSON parser's utility methods.

For example, if you are using the `com.google.gson.JsonObject` class, you can print
> Ok thank you id2 was the problem.
 Great to hear that you identified the issue with the key "id2". If you have added the null check as suggested, that should resolve the `NullPointerException`.

If you have further issues or need additional debugging, please feel free to ask!
