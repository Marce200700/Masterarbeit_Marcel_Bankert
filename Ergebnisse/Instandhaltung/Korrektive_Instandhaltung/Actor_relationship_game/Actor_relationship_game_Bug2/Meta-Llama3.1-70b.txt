Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.
>
Based on the error message, the issue lies in the `GraphCreation` class, specifically at line 57 in the `processMovieElement` method. The error is a `NullPointerException`, which means that the program is trying to access or manipulate a null object reference.

To fix this bug, you need to identify the null object reference and ensure that it is properly initialized before using it.

Here's a sample code snippet that might be causing the issue:
```java
public class GraphCreation {
    // ...

    public void processMovieElement(MovieElement movieElement) {
        // ...
        String movieTitle = movieElement.getTitle(); // Assume getTitle() returns null
        graph.addNode(movieTitle); // This will throw NullPointerException if movieTitle is null
        // ...
    }
}
```
To fix this, you can add a null check before using the `movieTitle` variable:
```java
public class GraphCreation {
    // ...

    public void processMovieElement(MovieElement movieElement) {
        // ...
        String movieTitle = movieElement.getTitle();
        if (movieTitle != null) {
            graph.addNode(movieTitle);
        } else {
            // Handle the case where movieTitle is null, e.g., log an error or skip the node
            System.out.println("Warning: Movie title is null, skipping node creation.");
        }
        // ...
    }
}
```
Alternatively, you can also consider using the `Optional` class in Java to handle null values in a more elegant way:
```java
public class GraphCreation {
    // ...

    public void processMovieElement(MovieElement movieElement) {
        // ...
        Optional<String> movieTitle = Optional.ofNullable(movieElement.getTitle());
        movieTitle.ifPresent(graph::addNode);
        // ...
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Optional` class is used to wrap the `movieTitle` variable, and the `ifPresent` method is used to add the node to the graph only if the `movieTitle` is not null.

Make sure to update the code accordingly to fix the bug, and then re-run the tests to verify that the issue is resolved.

As for the deprecated Gradle features warning, you can update your Gradle configuration to use the latest version and avoid using deprecated features. However, this warning does not affect the functionality of your code, so you can ignore it for now.

It seems like you didn't provide any additional information or context. Please let me know
> Well the code I gave you is the one from the error message.
It seems like you're having trouble with the same code, but you didn't provide any additional details or context. Could you please provide more information about the issue you're facing, such as:

* The exact error message or stacktrace you're seeing
* The code changes you made to try to fix the issue
* Any additional details
> I already gave you the error that I am facing
You're right, you did provide the error message earlier. To recap, the error is a `NullPointerException` in the `GraphCreation` class, specifically at line 57 in the `processMovieElement` method.

I provided a potential solution to this issue earlier, which involved adding a null check before using the `movieTitle` variable.

If you've tried this solution and are still facing issues, could you please provide more context or details about the `GraphCreation` class and the `processMovieElement` method? This will help me better understand the issue and provide a more accurate solution.

Additionally, I'd like to know:

* What is the purpose of the `GraphCreation` class and the `processMovieElement` method?
* What is the expected input and output of the `processMovieElement` method?
* Are there any other error messages or warnings that you're seeing in the console output?

Any additional information you can provide will help me better understand the issue and provide a more effective solution.

> The GraphCreation class is Responsible for creating the initial graph using data from TMDB API. The 'processMovieElement' method takes a JSONElement as the movielement and an actor id. It adds the actor to the provided movieleement. I do not have any further error messages than the ones I have already provided.
Based on the information you provided, it seems like the `NullPointerException` is occurring because the `movieElement` object or one of its properties is null.

To further diagnose the issue, I would recommend adding some debug logging or print statements to the `processMovieElement` method to see what values are being passed to the method and which properties are null.

Here's an example of how you could add some debug logging:
```java
public void processMovieElement(JSONElement movieElement, String actorId) {
    System.out.println("Processing movie element: " + movieElement);
    System.out.println("Actor ID: " + actorId);

    // Check if movieElement is null
> Ok line 57 really seems to be the problem because the movieId seems to be null.
That's a good clue! So, the `movieId` is null, which is causing the `NullPointerException`. Now, let's think about why the `movieId` might be null.

Here are a few possibilities:

1. The `movieElement` object doesn't have a `movieId` property.
2. The `movieId` property is not being deserialized correctly from the JSON data.
3. The `movieId` property is null in the JSON data itself.

To troubleshoot this, you can try the following:

1. Check the JSON data that's being passed to the `processMovieElement` method to see if it contains a `movieId` property.
2. Verify that the `movieElement` object is being deserialized correctly from the JSON data.
3. Add a null check for the `movieId` property before trying to use it.

Here's an example of how you could add a null check:
```java
String movieId = movieElement.getAsString("id");
if (movieId != null) {
    // Use the movieId
} else {
    System.out.println("Warning: Movie ID is null");
    // Handle the case where movieId is null
}
```
Alternatively, you could use the `Optional` class to handle the null case in a more elegant way:
```java
Optional<String> movieId = Optional.ofNullable(movieElement.getAsString("id"));
movieId.ifPresent(id -> {
    // Use the movieId
});
```
By adding a null check or using the `Optional` class, you can avoid the `NullPointerException` and handle the case where the `movieId` is null.

> Ok can you provide the fixed code for line 57?
Since I don't have the exact code for line 57, I'll provide a general example of how you can fix it. Let's assume that line 57 is something like this:
```java
graph.addNode(movieElement.getAsString("id"));
```
To fix it, you can add a null check like this:
```java
String movieId = movieElement.getAsString("id");
if (movieId != null) {
    graph.addNode(movieId);
} else {
    System.out.println("Warning: Movie ID is null");
    // Handle the case where movieId is null
}
```
