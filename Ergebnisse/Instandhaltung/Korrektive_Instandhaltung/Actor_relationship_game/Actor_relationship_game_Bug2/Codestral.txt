Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.

The error is a NullPointerException that is being thrown in the GraphCreation class of your program. This typically happens when you're trying to use a reference that has not been initialized. The stack trace indicates that the error is occurring at line 57 of the GraphCreation.java file.

Without seeing the actual code, it's hard to provide a precise solution. However, based on the stack trace, it seems that the problem is likely in the `processMovieElement` method, which is called from the `populateGraphWithMoviesForActor` method.

Here's a general approach to debug this issue:

1. Check the `processMovieElement` method and make sure that all variables and objects used in it are properly initialized.
2. Check if the `movieElement` parameter passed to the `processMovieElement` method is null. If it is, that could be the cause of the NullPointerException.
3. Use a debugger to step through the code and see the values of variables at runtime. This can help you identify the exact cause of the error.

Here's a possible solution based on the information provided:

```java
// Make sure that the movieElement is not null before using it
if (movieElement != null) {
    // Your code here
} else {
    // Handle the case where movieElement is null
    // For example, you could log an error message or throw a custom exception
}
```

Remember to replace `// Your code here` with the actual code from your `processMovieElement` method. Also, consider adding error handling to deal with the case where `movieElement` is null, depending on the expected behavior of your program.
