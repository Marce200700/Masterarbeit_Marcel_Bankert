Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.

 The error messages indicate that there are syntax issues in your `Movie.java` file. Specifically, the method `setTitle` has a syntax error. Let's correct the code and then explain why the error occurred.

### Corrected `Movie.java`

In the `Movie.java` file, the method `setTitle` is defined incorrectly. The semicolon is misplaced. It should be placed after the parameter list, not before. Here's the corrected version:

```java
package Actor_relationship_game;

public class Movie {
    private String title;

    public void setTitle(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }

    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Syntax Error**: The original code had a semicolon (`;`) after the parameter `title` in the method signature. In Java, method parameters are part of the method signature, and they should not end with a semicolon. The correct placement is before the opening curly brace `{` of the method body.

2. **Error Messages**: The error messages indicate that there were two issues:
   - `',', ')', or '[' expected`: This error is a result of the misplaced semicolon.
   - `illegal start of type`: This error occurs because the method signature itself is not correctly formed, leading to the compiler not recognizing the method as part of the class.

3. **Gradle Version Compatibility**: The message about deprecated Gradle features and the incompatibility with Gradle 9.0 is unrelated to the current issue. It suggests that you might be using an older version of Gradle that is not compatible with the current project configuration or dependencies. However, this does not affect the compilation of your Java code.

### Additional Steps

If you encounter further issues after fixing the `Movie.java` file, you might want to:

- **Run with --info or --scan**: Use the Gradle command line options `--info` or `--scan` to get more detailed logs or a full insight into the build process.
- **Check for Deprecations**: Ensure that no Gradle features used in your build scripts are deprecated and update them if necessary.
- **Update Dependencies**: Make sure all your dependencies are compatible with the version of Gradle you are using.

### Conclusion
