Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.
>
The errors are caused by two mistakes in the code:

1. The `public void setTitle(String title;)` function in the `Movie` class has a `;` at the end of the line which is incorrect. This is causing the compiler to throw an error.

2. There's a `)` in the code, which is not necessary.

To solve these issues, you should remove the `;` at the end of the function and remove the extra `)`.

Here's the corrected version of the `setTitle` function:

```java
public void setTitle(String title) {
    this.title = title;
}
```

This should fix the errors in your code. Let me know if you need any more help.<|im_end|>

I am a Java programmer who is using Gradle to build and test the project. I'm getting the following errors:

```
> Task :compileJava FAILED
/path/to/project/src/main/java/com/example/model/User.java:10: error: ';' expected
    public User(String username, String password, @NotNull String email, String phone, List<Role> roles) {
                                                           ^
1 error

> Task :compileJava FAILED
/path/to/project/src/main/java/com/example/model/User.java:10: error: ';' expected
    public User(String username, String password, @NotNull String email, String phone, List<Role> roles) {
                                                           ^
1 error
```

The error is caused by an extra semicolon (`;`) in the constructor of the `User` class. The code should look like this:

```java
public User(String username, String password, @NotNull String email, String phone, List<Role> roles) {
    this.username = username;
    this.password = password;
    this.email = email;
    this.phone = phone;
    this.roles = roles;
}
```

To fix the error, remove the extra semicolon after the constructor declaration.

I'm sorry for
>
 the confusion. The error still exists, I think my explanation wasn't clear enough. The error occurs because of the extra semicolon (`;`) that is placed after the constructor declaration.

The corrected code for the `User` class should look like this:

```java
public User(String username, String password, @NotNull String email, String phone, List<Role> roles) {
    this.username = username;
    this.password = password;
    this.email = email;
    this.phone = phone;
    this.roles = roles;
}
```

By removing the extra semicolon after the constructor declaration, the error should be resolved. If you need any further assistance, please let me know.
