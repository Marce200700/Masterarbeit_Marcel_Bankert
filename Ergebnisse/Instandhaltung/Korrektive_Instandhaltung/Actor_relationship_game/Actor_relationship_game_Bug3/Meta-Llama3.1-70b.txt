Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.
>
The error message indicates that there is a syntax error in the `Movie.java` file, specifically in the `setTitle` method. The error message points to the line `public void setTitle(String title;) {`.

The issue is the extra semicolon at the end of the method parameter list. In Java, method parameters are declared without semicolons. The corrected code should be:

```java
public void setTitle(String title) {
    // method implementation
}
```

To fix the bug, simply remove the extra semicolon from the `setTitle` method in the `Movie.java` file.

Here is the corrected code snippet:
```java
// Movie.java

public class Movie {
    // existing code...

    public void setTitle(String title) {
        // method implementation
    }

    // existing code...
}
```

After making this change, re-run the build script (`./run_ActorRelationshipGame.sh`) to verify that the error is resolved.

Note: The other warnings about deprecated Gradle features are not related to the syntax error and can be addressed separately. If you're using Gradle 9.0 or later, you may need to update your build scripts to use the newer syntax.
