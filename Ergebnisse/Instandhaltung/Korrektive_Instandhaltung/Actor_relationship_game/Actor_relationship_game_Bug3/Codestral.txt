Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.
>
The problem is with the method `setTitle` in the `Movie` class. The declaration of the method has a semicolon after the parameter, which is causing the compilation errors.

Here is the correct declaration of the method:

```java
public void setTitle(String title) {
    this.title = title;
}
```

This method should be in the `Movie` class. Please check your code and replace the incorrect method declaration with the correct one. The rest of the code seems to be fine based on the information provided.

> Thank you
