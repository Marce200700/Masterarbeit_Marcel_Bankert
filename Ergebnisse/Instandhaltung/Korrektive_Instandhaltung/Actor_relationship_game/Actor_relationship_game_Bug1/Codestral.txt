Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.
>
The error message is indicating that the `get` method is not found in the `Movie` class when it is called with a `Map<String, Actor>` as an argument.

Looking at the provided code snippet, it seems that the `Movie` class does not have a `get` method that accepts a `Map<String, Actor>` as an argument. This is likely the source of the error.

To fix the bug, you need to modify the code in the `ActorGraph` class on line 93. Instead of calling `Movie.get(actors)`, you should modify the code to retrieve the `Actor` object from the `actors` map using a valid key.

Here is an example of how you can modify the code:

```java
String actorKey = // obtain the key for the actor you want to retrieve
Actor actor = actors.get(actorKey);
```

Without knowing the exact structure of your codebase, I can't provide a more specific solution. Make sure to replace `// obtain the key for the actor you want to retrieve` with the appropriate code to obtain the key from your application's logic.
