Thank you very much. I have generated the fixed code for the part of the ActorGraph.java file which causes the error.

You can use this code:

    static Map<String, Actor> actors = new HashMap<>();

        return actors.get(actorId);
    }

    public static void add(Actor actor) {
        actors.put(actor.getId(), actor);
    }
}
class Actor {
    private String id;

    Actor(String id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }
}
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, Actor> actors = new HashMap<>();

        Actor actor = new Actor("1");
        Movie.add(actor);

        System.out.println(Movie.get("1"));
