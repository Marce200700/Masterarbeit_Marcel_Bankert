    unknown: Unexpected token (36:8)

      Jest encountered an unexpected token
      This usually means that you are trying to import a file which Jest cannot parse, e.g. it's not plain JavaScript.
      By default, if Jest sees a Babel config, it will use that to transform your files, ignoring "node_modules".
      Here's what you can do:
       • To have some of your "node_modules" files transformed, you can specify a custom "transformIgnorePatterns" in your config.
       • If you need a custom transformation specify a "transform" option in your config.
       • If you simply want to mock your non-JS modules (e.g. binary assets) you can stub them out with the "moduleNameMapper" config option.
      You'll find more details and examples of these config options in the docs:

Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.
>
The errors you're experiencing are related to Vue.js and Jest testing. The warnings about unknown custom elements (`<router-link>`) suggest that these elements are not registered in your tests. This can happen when you're using Vue Router in your components, but you're not mocking it in your tests.

To fix this, you can mock the `<router-link>` component in your tests. Here's a simple way to do it:

1. Create a `__mocks__` directory at the root of your project (if it doesn't exist).
2. Inside the `__mocks__` directory, create a `vue-router.js` file.
3. In the `vue-router.js` file, add the following code:

```javascript
export default {
  install(_Vue) {
    _Vue.component('router-link', {
      render: function (h) {
        return h('div', this.$slots.default)
      }
    })
  }
}
```

This code will replace the `<router-link>` component with a `<div>` in your tests, allowing them to run without errors.

As for the unexpected token error in `LoginPage.spec.js`, it seems that there's a syntax error in that file. The error message suggests that the issue is with a line that includes a spread operator (`...`). However, without seeing the code, I can't provide a more specific solution. Make sure that the syntax is correct and that you're using the spread operator correctly.

If you continue to have issues, please provide the relevant code snippets, and I'll do my best to help you further.

> Ok which Vue component causes the issue?
 Based on the error message, the issue is with a component that uses the `<router-link>` element. However, without seeing the code, I can't determine which specific component is causing the issue.

The error message suggests that this issue is occurring in multiple components, such as `HomePage.vue`, `RegisterPage.vue`, and `LoginPage.spec.js`. I
> What about the LoginPage.vue component?
 The error message you provided indicates that there's an unexpected token error in the `LoginPage.spec.js` file, not in the `LoginPage.vue` component. This suggests that the issue is with your test for the `LoginPage.vue` component, not with the component itself.

Without seeing the code for `LoginPage.spec.js`, it's difficult for me to determine the exact cause of the error. However, the error message suggests that there's a syntax error on line 36 of that file. Based on the context provided in the error message, it seems that the issue might be with the use of the spread operator (`...`) on line 36.

To help you further, I would need to see the code for `LoginPage.spec.js` and the specific line that's causing the error. Could you please provide that information?

Here's the code:

import { shallowMount, createLocalVue } from '@vue/test-utils'
import Vuex from 'vuex'
import LoginPage from '@/components/LoginPage.vue'
import { account } from '@/_store/account.module'

const localVue = createLocalVue()
localVue.use(Vuex)

    let actions
    let state
    let store

    beforeEach(() => {
        actions = {
            login: jest.fn()
        }
        state = {
            account: { status: {} }
        }
        store = new Vuex.Store({
