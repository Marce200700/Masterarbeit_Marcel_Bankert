    unknown: Unexpected token (36:8)

      Jest encountered an unexpected token
      This usually means that you are trying to import a file which Jest cannot parse, e.g. it's not plain JavaScript.
      By default, if Jest sees a Babel config, it will use that to transform your files, ignoring "node_modules".
      Here's what you can do:
       • To have some of your "node_modules" files transformed, you can specify a custom "transformIgnorePatterns" in your config.
       • If you need a custom transformation specify a "transform" option in your config.
       • If you simply want to mock your non-JS modules (e.g. binary assets) you can stub them out with the "moduleNameMapper" config option.
      You'll find more details and examples of these config options in the docs:

The errors you're encountering are related to Jest's inability to parse certain files, specifically the `router-link` component and the `mapState` function.

**Error 1: Unknown custom element `<router-link>`**

This error occurs because Jest is trying to render the `router-link` component, but it's not aware of its existence. To fix this, you need to tell Jest to ignore the `node_modules` directory, which contains the Vue Router library.

Add the following configuration to your `jest.config.js` file:
```js
module.exports = {
  // ... other config options ...
  transformIgnorePatterns: ['<rootDir>/node_modules/(?!(vue-router|vue)/)'],
};
```
This tells Jest to ignore the `node_modules` directory, except for the `vue-router` and `vue` libraries.

**Error 2: Unexpected token `..mapState`**

This error occurs because Jest is trying to parse the `mapState` function, which is a part of the Vuex library. The `..` syntax is not valid JavaScript, and Jest is complaining about it.

To fix this, you need to tell Jest to transform the Vuex library using the `transform` option. Add the following configuration to your `jest.config.js` file:
```js
module.exports = {
  // ... other config options ...
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.js$': 'babel-jest',
    '^.+\\.vue$': '@vue/vue3-jest',
  },
};
```
This tells Jest to use the `babel-jest` transformer for JavaScript files and the `@vue/vue3-jest` transformer for Vue files.

**Error 3: Handlebars warnings**

These warnings are related to the `handlebars` library, which is used by Jest to render templates. You can safely ignore these warnings or add the following configuration to your `jest.config.js` file to disable them:
```js
module.exports = {
  // ... other config options ...
  globals: {
    'handlebars': {
      allowProtoMethodsByDefault: true,
    },
  },
};
```
This tells Handlebars to allow proto methods by default, which should silence the warnings.

**Full `jest.config.js` file**

Here's the complete `jest.config.js` file with all the configuration options:
```js
module.exports = {
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.js$': 'babel-jest',
    '^.+\\.vue$': '@vue/vue3-jest
> Ok this is the mapState call: export default {
    data () {
        return {
            username: '',
            password: '',
            submitted: false
        }
    },
    computed: {
        ..mapState('account', ['status'])
    },
What is wrong with the call?The issue with the `mapState` call is the use of the `..` syntax, which is not valid JavaScript.

In Vuex, the `mapState` function is used to map state properties from the Vuex store to local computed properties. However, the `..` syntax is not a valid way to call a function in JavaScript.

Instead, you should use the `...` syntax, known as the spread operator, to merge the `mapState` function with the local computed properties. Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      username: '',
      password: '',
      submitted: false
    }
  },
  computed: {
    ...mapState('account', ['status'])
  }
}
```

By using the `...` spread operator, you're merging the `mapState` function with the local computed properties, which will correctly map the `status` property from the `account` module to a local computed property.

Note that you'll also need to import the `mapState` function from Vuex:

```javascript
import { mapState } from 'vuex'
```

With this correction, the `mapState` call should work as expected.
