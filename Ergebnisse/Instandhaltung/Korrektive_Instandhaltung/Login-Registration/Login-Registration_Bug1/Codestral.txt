Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.

> Based on the error messages you've provided, it appears that you're encountering issues with unknown custom elements in your Vue.js application when running your unit tests. These elements are `<router-link>`, which are used for navigation in your Vue Router setup.

The issue is likely due to the fact that when you're running your tests, Vue Test Utils doesn't have access to the Vue Router library, which is why it's unable to find and render these elements.

To fix this issue, you can use Vue Test Utils' stub functionality to create a stub implementation of the `<router-link>` element. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import { shallowMount, createLocalVue } from '@vue/test-utils';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';

const localVue = createLocalVue();
localVue.use(VueRouter);

describe('YourComponent.vue', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    const wrapper = shallowMount(YourComponent, {
      localVue,
      stubs: {
        'router-link': {
          template: '<div><slot/></div>',
          props: ['to']
        }
      }
    });

    // Your tests here
  });
});
```

In this example, I'm using the `shallowMount` function from `@vue/test-utils` to mount your component. I'm also using the `createLocalVue` function to create a local instance of Vue that includes the Vue Router. Then, I'm stubbing the `<router-link>` element by providing a simple template that just renders its slot, which allows Vue Test Utils to find and interact with the element in your tests.

You should apply this stubbing technique to all your test files where you're encountering this issue.

>
 It seems that your tests are failing due to unknown custom elements, specifically `<router-link>`. This issue occurs because Vue Test Utils doesn't have access to the Vue Router library when running your tests, causing it to fail to find and render these elements.

To resolve this issue, you can use Vue Test Util
> Ok I have tried your code but it did not work. Which vue-component causes the problem?
 Apologies for any confusion earlier. Without seeing your codebase, I couldn't determine exactly which component is causing the issue. However, the error message indicates that it's occurring in the `LoginPage.spec.js` test file, so I'd suggest starting there.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the error messages you're seeing:

1. Unknown custom element: Vue warns that it doesn't recognize the `<router-link>` element, which is used for navigation in your Vue Router setup. This warning is likely the root cause of your test failures.

2. Expected: true, Received: false: This error message indicates that an assertion in your test is failing. It's expecting a certain condition to be true, but it's actually false. Without seeing the specific line of code and the test case, it's difficult to provide more detailed guidance.

3. [vue-test-utils]: find did not return input[name="password"], cannot call setValue() on empty Wrapper: This error message suggests that Vue Test Utils couldn't find an input element with the name "password" in your component, causing the test to fail.

To further investigate the issue, I would recommend checking the following:

1. Make sure that the `<router-link>` element is properly used in your `LoginPage.vue` component.
2. Verify that the input elements with names "username" and "password" exist in your `LoginPage.vue` component.
3. Review the assertions in your test case to ensure that they are testing the expected behavior of your component.

By addressing these potential issues, you should be able to resolve the test failures and proceed with running your unit tests.

Maybe you can find the reason for the bug within this code snippet.

>  Based on the code you've provided for the `LoginPage.vue` component, I don't see any obvious issues that would cause the test failures you're experiencing. The component structure and the usage of Vuex actions seem correct.

However, without seeing the actual test code in `LoginPage.spec.js`, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of the test failures. I would recommend checking the following:

1. Make sure you're importing and configuring the Vue Router stub correctly in your test file. The stubbing technique I provided earlier should help with this.

2. Double-check the assertions in your test cases to ensure that they are testing the expected behavior of the component. For example, you might want to verify that the login action is dispatched with the correct username and password when the form is submitted.

3. Check for any typos or syntax errors in your test file that could be causing the test failures.

4. Make sure that you're using the correct selectors to find the input elements and other elements in your component. Incorrect selectors could lead to the "find did not return..." error messages you're seeing.
