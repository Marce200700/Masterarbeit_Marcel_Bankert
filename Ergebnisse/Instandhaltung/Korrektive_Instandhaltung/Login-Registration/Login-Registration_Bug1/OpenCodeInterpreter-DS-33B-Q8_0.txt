Please provide code and an explanation to fix the bug which causes the aforementioned errors.

> The errors are due to the vue-test-utils not being able to find the HTML elements which it's supposed to interact with. This is likely due to the lack of router-link component in the components tree during the tests.

To fix this, you should mock the router-link component. You can do this by adding the following line of code in your test setup file:

```javascript
jest.mock('vue-router', () => ({
  RouterLink: {
    render: h => h('a', {}, [''])
  }
}));
```

After adding this mock, your test cases should be able to interact with the components correctly and pass.

Please note that the mock will not execute the actual navigation logic of router-link. It just provides a simple placeholder for the component during the tests. If your tests need to interact with router-link in a way that needs actual navigation, you might need a more complex setup, such as using Vue Test Utils' `mount` method with a `global.mocks.$route`, which provides a way to mock the current route.

Also, please ensure that the package "vue-router" is installed in your project, otherwise the mock won't work.

Please replace the code in your test file and run the tests again.

Let me know if you need any further assistance.

> Ok do you think that any vue-component is causing the issue?
Yes, vue-test-utils might be failing to find the components that it's trying to test. This is likely due to the way that your components are structured and the way they're imported and used in your tests.

To fix this issue, you will need to correctly import and use the components in your tests. This may involve a few different steps, such as:

1. Ensuring that the components are correctly exported and imported in your Vue files.
> Ok which vue-component is causing this issue?
Without any further information, I'm afraid I can't provide the exact vue-component causing this issue. However, based on the error messages you provided, the error is likely to be related to the router-link component not being registered correctly.

To fix this issue, you could try the following steps:

1. Ensure that the router-link component is correctly imported in your Vue files.
2. Make sure that the router-link component is registered in your Vue instance.
3. Check that the router-link component is used correctly within your Vue templates.
4. Verify that the router-link component is being rendered in the components tree during the tests.

Please replace the code in your test file and run the tests again.

Let me know if you need any further assistance.
